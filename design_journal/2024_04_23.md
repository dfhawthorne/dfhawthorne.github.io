# 2024-04-23: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Several Pages Converted Manually

I decided to convert the pages from New Google Sites format manually because of the complexity of the code and the extensive use of `<IFRAME>` tags to include preformatted content. The following pages were converted manually:

* `docs/home/11g-oce-rac/section-1---grid-infrastructure-clusterware-and-asm/making-applications-highly-available-with-oracle-clusterware/describe-the-high-availability-components-of-oracle-clusterware.html`
* `docs/home/issues/oracle-enterprise-edition-issues/drop-administrative-user.html`
* `docs/home/system-builds/allawah/2021-02-02-planning-and-build-vm.html`

I removed the following pages:

* `docs/system.html` because it is not referred to by any other page;
* `docs/home/11g-oce-rac/section-1---grid-infrastructure-clusterware-and-asm/making-applications-highly-available-with-oracle-clusterware/describe-the-high-availability-components-of-oracle-clusterwar.html` because it had a spelling mistake.

I added the following pages:

* `docs/home/issues/oracle-enterprise-edition-issues.html` as a missing anchor page.

I updated the following pages:

* `docs/home/issues.html` to include new anchor page
* `docs/home/11g-oce-rac.html` to fix spelling mistake
* `docs/home/11g-oce-rac/section-1---grid-infrastructure-clusterware-and-asm/making-applications-highly-available-with-oracle-clusterware.html` to fix spelling mistakes

Eight (8) New Google Sites pages remain to be converted.
