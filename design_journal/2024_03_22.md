# 2024-03-22: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Clean Up of Auxiliary Files

## Summary

I closed several issues that are related to auxiliary files. I had to replace Classic Google Sites version of two (2) pages with their New Google Sites version. The files download widget is replaced with an ordered list while removing older versions of the uploaded files.

## Issues

### 53: home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-1-new-features-of-oracle-database-12c/oracle-data-redaction.html has missing file

This issue [#53](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/53) has been closed as it cannot be reproduced.

### 54: No occurrences of 'apply_psu_201904_botany.log' were wrapped

This issue [#54](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/54) has been closed after several updates to the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`.

#### Analysis

There are two (2) versions of this file (`apply_psu_201904_botany.log`):

```text
find . -name "apply_psu_201904_botany.log*" -type f
./home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-2-key-dba-skills/core-administration/apply-and-review-patches/apply_psu_201904_botany.log?attredirects=0
./home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-2-key-dba-skills/core-administration/apply-and-review-patches/apply_psu_201904_botany.log?attredirects=0&d=1
```

This should result in the following GIT commands:

```bash
git rm 'docs/home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-2-key-dba-skills/core-administration/apply-and-review-patches/apply_psu_201904_botany.log?attredirects=0
git mv 'docs/home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-2-key-dba-skills/core-administration/apply-and-review-patches/apply_psu_201904_botany.log?attredirects=0&d=1' \
    'docs/home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-2-key-dba-skills/core-administration/apply-and-review-patches/apply_psu_201904_botany.log'
```

#### Proposed Design

If a download file is not referenced in the main content, a message will be written to the verbose log.

Any files in the associated directory (called `auxiliary_dir` in the script) that are not referenced in the file download widget will be scheduled for deletion.

All files in the file downloads widget will be converted. The following should be appended to the main content:

```html
<h2 id='TOC-File-Downloads'>File Downloads</h2>
<ol>
   <li>
    <a href="home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-2-key-dba-skills/core-administration/apply-and-review-patches/apply_psu_201904_botany.log">
       apply_psu_201904_botany.log
    </a>
  </li>
</ol>
```

And the TOC YAML code should have the following appended to it:

```yaml
- toc-url: 'File-Downloads'
  toc-text: 'File Downloads'
```

This means the `page_header` variable should be split in twain: TOC stuff (`toc_header`); and non-TOC stuff (`page_header`). Then these are combined at the end of the script.

### 55: Unable to locate image file, 'diagnos.html'

This issue [#55](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/55) has been closed. When issue [#56](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/56) was resolved, the web page, `diagnose-.html`, was removed as it was not stored in the New Google Sites version of the Wiki.

### 57: Uploaded file ('report.xml?attredirects=0&d=1') does not exist

This issue [#57](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/57) has been closed. When issue [#56](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/56) was resolved, any references to report.xml were removed as uploaded files are not stored in the New Google Sites version of the pages.

### 59: URL for diagnose-performance-issues-.html is incorrect

This issue [#59](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/59) has been closed. When issue [#56](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/56) was resolved, the web page, `diagnose-performance-issues-.html`, was removed as it was not stored in the New Google Sites version of the Wiki.

### 60: Missing URL: create-and-manage-users-roles-and-privileges.html

This issue [#60](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/60) was caused by the resolution of issue [#24](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/) (_Investigate Duplicate 12C OCM Pages_).

I manually changed the URL from `12-ocm` to `12c-ocm` in the web page, `docs/home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-1-new-features-of-oracle-database-12c/managing-tablespaces-common-and-local-users-privileges-and-roles/manage-users-and-privileges-for-cdb-pdb.html`, which was successfully converted.

This issue ([#60](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/60)) has been closed.

### 61: 12C OCP Upgrade Privileges Jekyll Errors - missing title

This issue [#61](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/61) has been closed.

The conversion script, scripts/convert_web_page.py, has been updated to enclose toc-url and toc-text values in apostrophes.

All pages in the directory, `docs/home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-1-new-features-of-oracle-database-12c/privileges`, were successfully converted.
