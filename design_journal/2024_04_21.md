# 2024-04-21: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Completed Conversion of Remaining Classic Pages

## Summary

I have completed the conversion of Classic Google Sites pages in my Wiki to Jekyll format.

## Table of Contents

* [Issues](#issues)
  * [90: Web Page has JAVASCRIPT:VOID(0) in URLs](#90-web-page-has-javascriptvoid0-in-urls)
  * [104: Unable to find the table containing the main content](#104-unable-to-find-the-table-containing-the-main-content)

## Issues

### 90: Web Page has JAVASCRIPT:VOID(0) in URLs

The remaining two (2) pages have been fixed:

* `<IMG>` tags had a source of `javascript:void(0);`. The conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, was updated to remove these tags.
* The other web page had missing links. I corrected these links manually.

Issue [#90](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/90) has been closed.

### 104: Unable to find the table containing the main content

The script, `script/find_unconverted_pages.py`, mis-classified pages as unconverted that are of the format:

* `/_layouts/`
* `/_includes/`
* `/google`
* `/ASH_report_`
* `/workload_report_`

I also updated the classification script, `scripts/classify_web_page.sh`, to follow the same classification.

I wrote an extra script, `scripts/find_unconverted_classic_web_pages.sh`, to find any Classic Google Sites pages that I had missed.

Issue [#104](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/104) has been closed.
