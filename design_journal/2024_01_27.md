# 2024-01-27: First Build of Wiki Using Jekyll

## Summary

I have started the conversion of the Wiki landing page to Jekyll format using the Jekyll tutorial.

## Table of Contents

* [Minor Cleanup of Wiki](#minor-cleanup-of-wiki)
* [Cleanup of Git Ignore](#cleanup-of-git-ignore)
* [Jekyll Files](#jekyll-files)
* [Layout of Home Page](#layout-of-home-page)
* [Generation of Navigation Bars](#generation-of-navigation-bars)

## Minor Cleanup of Wiki

I renamed the `docs/home/12-ocm` to `docs/home/12c-ocm` in order to match other OCM and OCE directories.

## Cleanup of Git Ignore

The Git Ignore file is split into two (2):

1. top level for test files and logs
2. Jekyll specific in `docs/.gitignore`

## Jekyll Files

The following file and directories have been added:

* `docs/_config.yml`
* `docs/_data/`
* `docs/_includes/`
* `docs/_layouts/`
* `docs/_sass/`
* `docs/assets/`

## Layout of Home Page

There are three (3) regions to the landing or home page:

1. __Banner__ which displays the site banner
1. __Side_Nav_Bar__ which displays the site navigation
1. __Content__ which contains the page content

The layout is a two (2) by two (2) grid.

## Generation of Navigation Bars

The data for the navigation bars are generated by the script, `scripts/build_nav_data.py`.

Sample execution is:
```bash
scripts/build_nav_data.py --side-nav docs/_data/side_nav.yml --top-nav docs/_data/top_nav.yml docs
```
