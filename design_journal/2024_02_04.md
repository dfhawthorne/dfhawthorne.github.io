# 2024-02-04: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Web Page Conversion Started

## Summary

Now that I have identified key parts of a Classic Google Sites page, I need to write a program to convert these web pages to Jekyll. There was a problem with the inclusion of New Google Sites pages.

## Parts of Web Pages

The parts of the web pages that I have identified in this journal are:

| Element | Design Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Breadcrumbs | [2024-02-01](2024_02_01.md#breadcrumbs) |
| Content | [2024-02-02](2024_02_02.md#extract-content) |
| Table of Contents | [2024-02-01](2024_02_01.md#additional-page-division)  [2024-02-02](2024_02_02.md#extract-table-of-contents) |
| Journal Scroll Links | [2024-02-03](2024_02_03.md#journal-scroll-links) |
| Sub-Pages Menu | [2024-02-03](2024_02_03.md#sub-page-menu) |
| Bottom Panel | [2024-02-03](2024_02_03.md#bottom-panel) |

## Conversion Script

### Purpose

The purpose of the conversion script is to:

1. extract the contents
1. extract the other elements and convert the data to YAML format
1. produce a Jekyll format page
1. optionally replace the web page with the Jekyll formatted one

### Script Name

The conversion script is to be called `scripts/convert_web_page.py`.

### Breadcrumbs

Fortunately, the Classic Google Sites pages had a script that set a `breadcrumbs' variable. A sample snippet is:

```javascript
var breadcrumbs = [{"path":"/home","deleted":false,"title":"Home","dir":"ltr"},{"path":"/home/system-builds","deleted":false,"title":"System Builds","dir":"ltr"}];
```

This is converted to:

```yaml
breadcrumbs:
- title: Home
  url: /home
- title: System Builds
  url: /home/system-builds
```

## New Google Sites Pages

I seem to have New Google Sites pages mixed up in my repository. I ran the following commands to extract all web pages that do not have the class, `sites-tile-name-content-1`,:

```bash
cd docs/home
diff \
    <(find . -type f -name "*.html" | grep -ivE "(png|attredirects)") \
    <(grep -irl sites-tile-name-content-1 .) | \
    sed -nre '/^</p' | \
    cut -d\  -f2
```

The result is:

```text
./issues/oracle-enterprise-edition-issues/drop-administrative-user.html
./12c-ocp-upgrade/section-1-new-features-of-oracle-database-12c/emergency-monitoring-real-time-addm-compare-period-addm-and-active-session-history-ash-analytics/generate-addm-compare-period.html

./10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/miscellaneous/vip-problem-on-richmond1-03.html
```

These web pages have the following code at the beginning:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html lang="en-US" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WebPage">
```

Whereas Classic Google Sites pages start with:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
```

However, there is one (1) exception:

```bash
diff \
    <(diff \
        <(find . -type f -name "*.html" | grep -ivE "(png|attredirects)") \
        <(grep -irl sites-tile-name-content-1 .) | \
        sed -nre '/^</p' | \
        cut -d\  -f2 \
      ) \
    <(grep -irl "http://schema.org/WebPage" .) | \
    sed -nre '/^</p' | \
    cut -d\  -f2
```

The result is:

```text
./12c-ocp-upgrade/section-1-new-features-of-oracle-database-12c/emergency-monitoring-real-time-addm-compare-period-addm-and-active-session-history-ash-analytics/generate-addm-compare-period.html
```

This web page appears to be corrupted. I updated it manually since it was a very short page.
