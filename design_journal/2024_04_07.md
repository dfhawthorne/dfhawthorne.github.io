## Issues

### 20: Reference to Oracle Patch Details

Manually updated `apply-and-review-patches.html`. This was the only occurrence for converted web pages.

### 67: Convert 12C OCM Pages

The remaining 12C OCM pages to be converted are:

* `data-guard`
  * `configure-a-standby-database-for-testing`
    * `use-oem-to-convert-to-snapshot.html`
    * `use-dgmgrl-to-convert-to-snapshot-standby.html`
    * `use-oem-to-convert-to-physical-stanby.html`
  * `restore-the-standby-database-to-its-normal-function`
    * `use-sql-plus-to-convert-to-physical-stanby.html`
* `data-guard.html`

All pages other than `data-guard.html` were successfully converted. `data-guard.html` will be converted as part of issue [#33](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/33).

### 81: Links to My Oracle Support has session information

Issue [#81](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/81) was discovered while investigating issue [#20](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/20). The solution is to convert links like:

```html
  <a href="https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?_afrLoop=71658951412931&amp;id=29141015.8&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_adf.ctrl-state=1ca86jmcgq_1003" rel="nofollow">
```

To:

```html
  <a href="https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocContentDisplay?id=29141015.8" rel="nofollow">
```

The solution is manual at this stage. I will revisit this issue in V2R.
