# 2024-02-18: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Journal Scroll Bars

## Summary

I resolved several issues and expanded on the design decisions for the auxiliary functions in the Web Page Conversion script. I have started the extraction of the journal scroll bar.

* #22 "[Title Bar Overflows into Content](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/22)"

### 4: Remove 'print page' widget

Since the 'print page' widget is outside of the scope of the main content, this widget is not being transferred to the Jekyll format pages by the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`.

Issue #4 ("[Remove 'print page' widget](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/4)") is marked as resolved.

### 5: Remove 'COMMENTS' widget

Since the 'COMMENTS' widget is outside of the scope of the main content, this widget is not being transferred to the Jekyll format pages by the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`.

Unfortunately, some content will be lost as some web pages have comments. This is a conscious design decision.

Issue #5 ("[Remove 'COMMENTS' widget](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/5)") is marked as resolved.

### 9: Investigate removal of miscellaneous pages

The code in the web page conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, was:

* updated to identify web pages with the following suffixed:
  * `.png.html`
  * `.gif.html`
  * `attredirects=0`
* remove links to them from other web pages
* use `git rm` to remove the files

Issue #9 ("[Investigate removal of miscellaneous pages](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/9)") was fixed by commit 6965103e425e9a41f7e7a77e4276f22be349b9c5, and was marked as resolved.

### 10: Empty page: file-cabinet.html

Since the page, `file-cabinet.html`, has no useful content, I deleted the page.

Issue #10 ("[Empty page: https://dfhawthorne.github.io/file-cabinet.html](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/10)") was fixed by commit 6965103e425e9a41f7e7a77e4276f22be349b9c5, and was marked as resolved.

### 12: Remove Google Analytics code

Since the Google Analytics code is implemented in Javascript which is not being transferred to the Jekyll format pages by the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, issue #12 ("[Remove Google Analytics code](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/12)") has been marked as resolved.

### 14: Files still missing after issue #6 fixed

Issue #14 ("[Files still missing after issue #6 fixed](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/14)") was marked as resolved by issue #9 ("[Investigate removal of miscellaneous pages](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/9)") since both issues mention the same files.

### 15: Pages show message "You do not have permission to add comments."

Since the 'COMMENTS' widget is outside of the scope of the main content, this widget is not being transferred to the Jekyll format pages by the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`.

Issue #15 ("[Pages show message "You do not have permission to add comments."](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/15)") has been marked as resolved.

### 22: Title Bar Overflows into Content

I updated `docs/_sass/_page_title.scss` to use `min-height` instead of `height`. This resolves issue #22 ("[Title Bar Overflows into Content](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/22)")

## Further Discussion of Creating Auxiliary Functions

The main criterion for creating the following auxiliary functions in the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, is the reduction in complexity of the code:

* `need_to_remove_url`
* `normalise_url`

The creation of these auxiliary routines seems to contradicts the advice given in “[A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1732102201)” by [John Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) for modules to be shallow.

The depth of this script is now two (2). I think the reduction in complexity of the modules, and consqequent debugging justifies this increase in depth.

## Journal Scroll Bars

I have raised issue #23 ("[Convert Journal Scroll Bar for Classic Google Sites](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/23)").

Unfortunately, there are two (2) main issues:

1. Some old journal pages do not have scroll bars. I will have to add code to identify these pages.
1. Some newer journal pages are in the new Google Sites format. I will work on this conversion in a latter release.

### First Test Case

I have chosen `docs/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/rmancat/rmancat-01.html` as the first test case. The relevant HTML snippet is:

```html
<table border="0" cellspacing="10" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td align="left"></td>
      <td align="right"> <a href="rmancat-02.html"> RMANCAT (02) </a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

The expected YAML code should be:

```yaml
scroll-bar:
  right-link:
    title: RMANCAT (02)
    url: home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/rmancat/rmancat-01.html
```
