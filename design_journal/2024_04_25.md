# 2024-04-25: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Duplication of HOME and INDEX Web Pages

Issue [#16](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/16) was raised for "_The docs/index.html page should re-direct to docs/home.html_".

The original Wiki capture (via [wget](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/wget.1.html)) created two (2) pages that were duplicates:

1. `home.html`
1. `index.html`

It appears that fetching `index.html` caused a redirection to `home.html`. My Jekyll skills are not sufficient to reproduce this behaviour.

My solution is to convert all links within my Wiki to `Home` to direct to `index.html`. This is done in three (3) places:

1. Breadcrumbs in YAML page headers
1. `docs/_data/navigation.yml`
1. `docs/_includes/navigation.html`

All web pages, in the `docs/home` subdirectory, now have the following YAML snippet:

```yaml
breadcrumbs:
- title: Home
  url: index.html
```

Similar changes are made to `docs/_data/navigation.yml` and `docs/_includes/navigation.html`.

__NOTE:__ There is an implicit design rule that each directory under `docs` has an associated anchor page. That is, the `docs/home` subdirectory should have an anchor page called `docs/home.html`. This solution has the potential to create a bug.
