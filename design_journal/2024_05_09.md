# 2024-05-09: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Redesign of File Download Widget

## Summary

The file download widget are to be converted from a HTML code to YAML as part of resolving issue [#92](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/92).

## Redesign of Page Layout

I propose that the HTML code for the File Download Widget be converted to YAML format.

Since the File Download Widget is positioned directly above the page footer, such a conversion would not cause problems like what happened with the Sub-pages widget which can be positioned within the page content.

## Updated Page Layout

I moved the breadcrumbs up to row 2 in order to improve the aesthetics of the page. The page layout is now:

The default page layout is now:

| Row | Column 1 | Column 2 |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | banner | banner |
| 2 | navigation | breadcrumbs |
| 3 | navigation | page title |
| 4 | navigation | search box |
| 5 | navigation | top scroll bar |
| 6 | navigation | table of contents |
| 7 | navigation | content |
| 8 | navigation | sub pages menu |
| 9 | navigation | file download widget |
| 10 | navigation | bottom scroll bar |
| 11 | navigation | footer |
| 12 | navigation | spare |

Previous layouts were described on:

This has now become a monthly activity!

## Inclusion of Extra HTML Tags

The default layout, `docs/_layouts/default.html` has been updated to inlcude the following tags:

* `HEADER` tag which encompasses the following parts:
  * Breadcrumbs
  * Page title
  * Search box
  * Table of contents
* `MAIN` tag which encompasses the page content
* `FOOTER` tag which encompasses the following parts:
  * Subpages menu
  * File downloads widget
  * Copyright notice

The banner and side navigation parts were not included the `HEADER` tag because their inclusion corrupted the grid layout.
