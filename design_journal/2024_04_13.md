### 84: Upper journal scroll bars are not displayed

When I checked the system build journal for `CRONULLA`, the code for the journal scroll was enclosed in HTML similar to the following:

```html
<table width="100%">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td align="left" width="50%">
                <a href="...">...</a>
            </td>
            <td align="right" width="50%">
                <a href="...">...</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
```

I updated the script, `scripts/fix_issue_84.py`, to search for journal scroll bars in the following order of elements:

1. `<table width="100%">`
1. `<div style="display:block;width:100%">`
1. `<div style="display:block">`
1. `<div style="display:grid">`

I also introduced a global variable called `first_block` to avoid duplication of journal bars in case the page has both top and bottom scroll bars.

If an alignment is missing, I assume that the default alignment of 'left' is intended.
