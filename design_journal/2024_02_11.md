## Improved Performance of Find Converted Web Pages Script

I improved the performance of `scripts/find_converted_web_pages.sh` by 65%. See "[Using BASH Inbuilt Functions to Improve Script Performance](https://yaocm.wordpress.com/2024/02/11/using-bash-inbuilt-functions-to-improve-script-performance/#more-1687)" for performance test results.

## Removed 'png.html' Files

I identified the '*.png.html' files referenced by already converted web pages as follows:

```bash
cd docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management
sed -nre '/.png.html/p' 11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html | \
    cut -d\" -f2 | \
    cut -d/ -f4
```

The files affected were:

```text
review_capture_workload.png.html
review_preprocess_workload.png.html
review_replay_workload.png.html
```

I removed these files as follows:

```bash
sed -nre '/.png.html/p' 11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html | \
    cut -d\" -f2 | \
    cut -d/ -f4 | \
    xargs git rm
```

I cleaned up the web page as follows:

```bash
sed -r -i.bak -e '/.png.html/d' 11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html
diff 11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html 11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html.bak
```

The changes made were:

```text
503a504
>  <img src="home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/review_capture_workload.png.html"/>
540a542
>  <img src="home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/review_preprocess_workload.png.html"/>
563a566
>  <img src="home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/review_replay_workload.png.html"/>
```

## Automation Needed

I cannot simply delete the "`*.png.html`" files, I need to delete them from GIT. I could do this through a subprocess call.
