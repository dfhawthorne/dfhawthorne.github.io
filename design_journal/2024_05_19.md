# 2024-05-19: Add EXAM Topics - Script Implementation (Completed)

## Summary

I completed the implementation of the script (`scripts/create_wiki_skel_for_exam.py`) to add exam topics to my Wiki.

## Page Layout Changes

I have made the following changes to the default page layout:

* The contents of `docs/_includes/banner.html` (one (1) line) has been incorporated directly into `docs/_layouts/default.html`.
* Added the CSS class, `exam-objective`, for Exam objectives.
