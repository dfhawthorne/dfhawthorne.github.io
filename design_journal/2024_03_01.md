## Issues

### 21: Google Sites Placeholder

This issue ([21](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/21) (_Google Sites Placeholder_)) was overlooked in the [V2R0](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/pull/30) release.

All of the placeholders referred to existing pages. The placeholders were replaced by actual links. Issue was closed.

### Issues Moved to V2R7

The following seven (7) issues has been moved to milestone V2R7 from V2R1:

ID | TITLE | LABELS
 ---: | --- | ---
[7](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/7)  | Utility to rebuild sub-pages | enhancement

These issues are not critical for the conversion of my Wiki to Jekyll format.

## Trial Conversion (Issue #31)

Issue [31](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/31) has been raised to track the _Conversion of 11G OCE RAC Web Pages_. Various issues were found during these trial conversions:

* [Embedded Sub-Pages Menu Found](#embedded-sub-pages-menu-found)
* [Empty Sub-Pages Menu Found](#empty-sub-pages-menu-found)
* [Unreferenced Web Page Found](#unreferenced-web-page-found)
* [Web Page With Both TOC and Sub-Pages](#web-page-with-both-toc-and-sub-pages)

### Embedded Sub-Pages Menu Found

The conversion of the web page, `docs/home/11g-oce-rac/system-builds.html`, reports:

```text
Sub-page widget not removed.
```

I have raised a documentation issue ([33](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/33)) to track occurrences of these pages. No other action is planned for this issue at this stage.

### Empty Sub-Pages Menu Found

The web page, `docs/home/11g-oce-rac/section-2---real-application-clusters.html`, has an empty sub-pages menu as revealed by:

```bash
hxnormalize -xe home/11g-oce-rac/section-2---real-application-clusters.html | \
    hxselect '#sites-toc-undefined'
```

The HTML snippet is:

```html
<div class="sites-embed sites-sidebar-nav" id="sites-toc-undefined" jotid="sites-toc-undefined" style="display:block; margin:5px auto 5px 0; text-align:left; width:auto;">
                                            <h4 class="sites-embed-title"> Topics</h4>

                                            <div class="sites-embed-content" onclick="JOT_SUBPAGE_click(event)" style="text-align: left;">
                                              <ul jotid="navList"></ul>
                                            </div>
                                          </div>
```

Issue [32](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/32) has been raised to track this issue.

### Unreferenced Web Page Found

`docs/home/11g-oce-rac/section-2---real-application-clusters.html` was removed because it is not referenced by `docs/home/11g-oce-rac.html`

### Web Page With Both TOC and Sub-Pages

The web page, `docs/home/11g-oce-rac.html`, fails to be displayed by Jekyll with the following messages:

```text
      Regenerating: 1 file(s) changed at 2024-03-01 21:27:00
                    home/11g-oce-rac.html
YAML Exception reading /home/douglas/git-repositories/dfhawthorne.github.io/docs/home/11g-oce-rac.html: (<unknown>): mapping values are not allowed in this context at line 12 column 44 
  Liquid Exception: Liquid error (line 5): undefined variable title in /home/douglas/git-repositories/dfhawthorne.github.io/docs/_layouts/default.html
             Error: Liquid error (line 5): undefined variable title
             Error: Run jekyll build --trace for more information.
```

The TOC was converted incorrectly:

```yaml
table-of-contents:
- toc-url: Section-1---Grid-Infrastructure:-Clusterware-and-ASM.html
  toc-text: Section 1 - Grid Infrastructure: Clusterware and ASM
- toc-url: Section-2---Real-Application-Clusters.html
  toc-text: Section 2 - Real Application Clusters
---
```

Issue [34](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/34) was raised to track this.
