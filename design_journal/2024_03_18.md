## Scripts

### bulk_convert_pages.sh

I created a new script, `scripts/bulk_convert_pages.sh`, to call the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, for all HTML files in the current directory with a verbose log in the `/tmp` directory.

### find_empty_pages.sh

I raised issue #[58](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/58) for the script, `scripts/find_empty_pages.sh`, not listing sub-pages menu pages as referring to empty web pages.

This script was written in response to issue #[39: Empty 11G OCM Wiki Pages Found](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/39) as described in the design journal entry for [2024-03-08](2024_03_08.md).

I made the following changes to the script:

```diff
@@ -35,6 +35,7 @@ do
          "${file_name}"
     [[ $? -eq 0 ]] && continue
     printf 'href="%s"\n' "${file_name}" >> "${empty_page_addr_fn}"
+    printf '  url: %s\n' "${file_name}" >> "${empty_page_addr_fn}"
     printf '%s\n' "${file_name}" >> "${empty_pages_fn}"
 done < <(find_converted_web_pages.sh)
```

The output is now:

```text
Web Pages With No Content That Are Not Sub-pages Menus

Web Pages With References To Empty Web Pages

home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-1-new-features-of-oracle-database-12c/backup-recovery-and-flashback-for-a-cdb-pdb/perform-recovery-of-cdb-and-pdb.html
```

Because of the multi-level sub-pages menus found, there is no easy way to remove the empty web pages while leaving the sub-pages menu structure intact because the menus are generated from YAML code.

The change was reversed and the issue was closed as not to fixed.
