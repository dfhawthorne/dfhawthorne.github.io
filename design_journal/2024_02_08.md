# 2024-02-08: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Cleaned Up Links to Images

## Summary

I converted several more Wiki pages using the script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, especially those with images.

## Table of Contents

* [Cleaned Up Positioning of Sub-Pages Element](#cleaned-up-positioning-of-sub-pages-element)
* [Matched CSS Style for Content](#matched-css-style-for-content)
* [Changes to Conversion Script](#changes-to-conversion-script)
  * [Strip Scheme and Network Location](#strip-scheme-and-network-location)
* [Further Pages Converted](#further-pages-converted)
* [Missing Images](#missing-images)

## Cleaned Up Positioning of Sub-Pages Element

The placement of the sub-pages element has cleaned up by placing the CSS elements, `grid-row` and `grid-column`, into the class style, `sub-pages` (`_sass/_sub_pages.scss`).

I also removed class specifications to all tags in `_includes/sub-pages.html` except for the `<div>` tag.

## Matched CSS Style for Content

The CSS class, `content`, now matches that of the classic Google Sites.

## Changes to Conversion Script

The conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, has been updated:

1. Only strip scheme and network location from URLs if they point to the old or current Wiki.
2. Remove `../yetanotherocm/` from URLs before processing
3. Writes to the correct file when doing a replacement

### Strip Scheme and Network Location

For URLs starting with the following text, this text is stripped from the URL:

* `https://dfhawthorne.github.io`
* `https://sites.google.com/view/yetanotherocm`

For example,

* `https://sites.google.com/view/yetanotherocm/home` is changed to `home`
* `https://dfhawthorne.github.io/home` is changed to `home`

## Further Pages Converted

The following pages have been converted:

1. `docs/book-reviews.html` to test table of contents.
1. `docs/home/system-builds.html` to test sub-pages
1. `docs/home/12c-ocm.html` to test link conversion. Had to manually convert links from `12-ocm` to `12c-ocm`.
1. `docs/home/reading-notes.html` shows short sub-pages menu bug of floating to bottom.
1. `docs/home/resource-allocations.html` shows short sub-pages menu bug of floating to bottom.
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html` to test external links and images.

## Missing Images

The following images are missing:

1.`OCM_ODb11gAdmin_clr.gif`

I have added code to the conversion script to detect missing images.

There are also missing images of the form:

```html
<img src="home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/review_replay_workload.png.html">
```

The link points to a HTML page, not an image.
