# 2024-02-21: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Updated Site Map for Google Search

[Build and submit a sitemap](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap) says:

> XML sitemaps are the most versatile of the sitemaps formats. It's extensible and can be used to supply additional data about [images](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/image-sitemaps), [video](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/video-sitemaps), and [news](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/news-sitemap) content, as well as the [localized versions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions) of your pages.

I wrote a script, called `scripts/update_sitemap.sh`, which creates an XML sitemap, called `docs/system/app/pages/sitemap.xml`. These changes have been done to the following branches:

* `main`
* `jekyll`

The sitemap from the `main` branch has been successfully submitted to Google Search. I need to wait another day to see the result of Google Search indexing.

Issue [11](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/11) has been modified to replace the dynamic page, `sitemap.html`, with the XML file, `sitemap.xml`.
