# 2024-04-26: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Embedded Sub-Pages Menu

Issue [#33 Embedded Sub-Pages Menus Found](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/33) has the following definition:

> An embedded sub-pages menu is defined as one that has displayable content following it.

The sub-pages menu widget is now split into two (2):

1. Box with content from the following YAML keys:
   1. `sub-pages-title` (optional)
   1. `sub-pages` (array of title and url pairs)
1. HTML generated from the array with the YAML key of `sub-pages-postlude` (optional)

The `sub-pages-postlude` was implemented only on the following two (2) pages:

1. `docs/home/12c-ocm/data-guard.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-oce-rac/system-builds.html`

All sub-pages have been updated except for those identified by `scripts/find_missing_sub_pages.sh`:

1. `docs/home/11g-oce-rac.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm.html`
1. `docs/home/12c-ocm.html`
1. `docs/home/12c-ocm/general-database-and-network-administration-and-backup-strategy/create-and-manage-pluggable-databases.html`
1. `docs/home/database-designs/much-ado-about-nothing.html`

The first three (3) of these are for top-level exam topics. The last two (2) have complicated decorations to the sub-pages menu.
