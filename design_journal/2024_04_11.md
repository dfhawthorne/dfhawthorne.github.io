## Issues

### 83: Conversion of System Builds Wiki pages to Jekyll format

During the first pass of the web page conversion, the following issues were detected:

* [#84: Upper journal scroll bars are not displayed](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/84)
* [#85: 2018-03-27-create-git-repository.html has incorrect TOC with dual numbering](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/85)
* [#86: '/home/system-builds/auburn/2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible/install_pip3.log' not found](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/86)

### 84: Upper journal scroll bars are not displayed

I raised this issue ([#84](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/84)) because the conversion script (`scripts/convert_web_page.py`) was not detecting HTML snippets like the following:

```html
      <div style="display:block;width:100%">
        <div style="display:block;width:50%;text-align:left;float:left"
          > <a
          href="home/system-builds/auburn/2018-03-25-install-extra-python-modules.html"
          > 2018-03-25 Install Extra Python Modules </a></div>

        <div
          style="display:block;width:50%;text-align:right;float:right"
          > <a
          href="home/system-builds/auburn/2018-03-29-add-extra-disk-drive.html"
          > 2018-03-29 Add Extra Disk Drive </a></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Other variants are:

```html
<div style="display:block">
```

And:

```html
<div style="display:grid">
```

I created a script, `scripts/fix_issue_84.py`, to fix converted web pages that have scroll bars that were not detected by the main conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`. The pages fixed were:

* `docs`
  * `home`
    * `system-builds`
      * `AUBURN`
        * `2018-02-21-planning.html`
        * `2018-02-22-create-vm.html`
        * `2018-02-26-finish-server-installation.html`
        * `2018-02-27-install-ansible.html`
        * `2018-03-25-install-extra-python-modules.html`
        * `2018-03-27-create-git-repository.html`
        * `2018-03-29-add-extra-disk-drive.html`

There was one (1) web page found (`docs/home/system-builds/auburn/2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html`) that had a journal scroll bar entry that defaulted to a default alignment of left. Issue [#87](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/87) was raised.

### 86: '/home/system-builds/auburn/2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible/install_pip3.log' not found

I fixed this issue ([#86](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/86)) by running the following commands:

```bash
cd docs/home/system-builds/auburn/2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible
git mv 'install_pip3.log?attredirects=0&d=1' 'install_pip3.log'                   
git rm 'install_pip3.log?attredirects=0'
```

The clean-up of the auxiliary files failed somehow during the conversion, but I failed to detect the failure.

## Conversion Script Changes

Changed conversion script (scripts/convert_web_page.py):

* Updated comments
* Quoted file names in GIT MV command for auxiliary files
* Added logging of GIT MV command for auxiliary files
* Only print prompt to run GIT commands if there are GIT commands to run

## Other Script Changes

The script, `scripts/find_unconverted_web_pages.sh`, has been updated to exclude the Jekyll directory, `_layout`, as well.

The script, `scripts/classify_web_pages.sh`, has extended the definition of New Google Sites to include those starting with '<!DOCTYPE html>'.
