## Issues

### 11: Site Map not working correctly

With the resolution of issue [13](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/13) to use [DuckDuckGo](duckduckgo.com) instead of Google Search, issue [11](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/11) is closed without resolution.

### 13: Add Search Function using Google

Issue [13](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/13) will now use [DuckDuckGo](duckduckgo.com).

I created:

* `docs/_includes/search_box.html`
* `docs/_sass/_search_box.scss`

These two (2) files create a form that is submitted to Duckduckgo with the 'site:' keyword pre-filled in.

The form is right-aligned on the third row of the default page layout.

### 39: Empty 11G OCM Wiki Pages Found

I wrote a script, `scripts/find_empty_pages.sh`, to find all converted web pages that:

* Had no content
* Were not sub-page menus

The seven (7) pages found were:

1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-data-and-data-warehouse-management/11g-ocm-use-and-access-securefile-lobs.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-data-and-data-warehouse-management/11g-ocm-add-a-tablespace-by-using-transportable-tablespace-feature-of-data-pump-import.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-data-and-data-warehouse-management/11g-ocm-configure-and-use-parallel-execution-for-queries.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-data-and-data-warehouse-management/11g-ocm-use-oracle-streams-to-capture-and-propagate-changes-in-a-table.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-data-guard/11g-ocm-convert-the-standby-to-a-snapshot-standby.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-system-builds/data-guard/02-set-up-flashback-on-bankstown.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-system-builds/data-guard/03-create-physical-standby-on-padstow.html`

Only two (2) other web pages referenced these empty web pages:

1. `docs/home/11g-ocm.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html`

The first file above is expected as it is the root menu for all 11G OCM pages.

The second file above only has one (1) reference to an empty web page:

```html
   <a href="home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-data-guard/11g-ocm-convert-the-standby-to-a-snapshot-standby.html">
    Convert the standby to a snapshot standby
   </a>
```

The references to empty web pages were removed manually from the following pages:

1. `docs/home/11g-ocm.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload.html`
1. `docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-system-builds/data-guard.html`

The third page was not detected by the script, `scripts/find_empty_pages.sh`.

Removed all empty web pages.

### 41: Web Page Width is Too Wide on Reduction

Issue [41](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/41) has been resolved by updating `docs/_sass/_content.scss` to have:

```css
overflow: hidden;
```

### 48: Uploaded Files Should Not Be Converted

Issue [48](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/48) was raised for attempting to convert the following files:

```text
docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-set-up-and-configure-resource-manager/ASH_report_1327656054538.html
docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload/workload_report_1329872485962.html
docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-replay-a-captured-workload/workload_report_1329885258683.html
```

Updated `scripts/find_unconverted_web_pages.sh` to ignore files with the first line of

```html
<meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" http-equiv="content-type"/>
```

This was verified as follows:

```bash
find_unconverted_web_pages.sh | \
    grep 11g-ocm
```

The result is:

```text
/home/douglas/git-repositories/dfhawthorne.github.io/docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-use-sql-access-advisor.html
```

### 49: Conversion of 11g-ocm-use-sql-access-advisor.html Failed

Issue [49](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/49) was raised because the following conversion failed:

```bash
convert_web_page.py -rgvl /tmp/a.log docs/home/11g-ocm/11g-ocm-performance-management/11g-ocm-use-sql-access-advisor.html
```

The error message was:

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/douglas/bin/convert_web_page.py", line 784, in <module>
    uploaded_file_name = tag.a.string.strip()
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'string'
```
