### 52: Incorrect Sub-Pages Menu for 12C OCP Upgrade Anchor Page

During a test conversion of `docs/home/12c-ocp-upgrade.html`, shows only one (1) level in the sub-pages menu instead of three (3):

```yaml
sub-pages-title: 'Exam Topics'
sub-pages:
- title: 'Section 1: New Features of Oracle Database 12c'
  url: home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-1-new-features-of-oracle-database-12c.html
- title: 'Section 2: Key DBA Skills'
  url: home/12c-ocp-upgrade/section-2-key-dba-skills.html
---
```

This was resolved by updating the conversion script,  scripts/convert_web_page.py , with a function,  extract_sub_menu_level , that:

1. Has two (2) parameters:
   1. Tag of the sub-page menu level
   2. Level of tag within hierarchy starting at one (1)
2. Converts all `<li>` tags to sub-page menu entries
3. Calls itself if the `<li>` tag contains a `<ul>` or `<ol>` tag
4. Calls itself if there is a bare `<ul>` or `<ol>` tag
5. Returns a string containing the YAML code
