## Fix Installation Script

I fixed the installation script, `install_jekyll.yml`, to use a loop instead a list of gems to be installed.

## Set Up Test Site

```bash
jekyll new gh-pages/
```

The problem was that I could not access the website from a host other than `JANNALI`.

## Moved Installation to COOGEE

I committed my work on `JANNALI` and pushed it to GitHub.

I stashed my current work on `COOGEE`, and pulled the updates from GitHub.

## Changed Installation Script

Because `COOGEE` is a Ubuntu workstation, I had to adjust the installation script, `install_jekyll.yml`, to accommodate both RedHat and Debian.
