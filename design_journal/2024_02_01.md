# 2024-02-01: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Navigation and Table of Contents

## Summary

In examining the web pages, I restyled the navigation bars, and deployed a table of contents.

## Table of Contents

- [Reclassification of Navigation Bars](#reclassification-of-navigation-bars)
  - [Clarification of Names](#clarification-of-names)
  - [Breadcrumbs](#breadcrumbs)
- [Additional Page Division](#additional-page-division)

## Reclassification of Navigation Bars

### Clarification of Names

I have clarified the names of the navigation bars by renaming:

- Top navigation bar to `breadcrumbs`. This matches the description used in the Classic Google Sites code.
- Side navigation bar to `navigation`. Since there is now only one (1) navigation bar, there is no need to distinguish by page placement (side versus top).

### Breadcrumbs

The top navigation bar is now called `breadcrumbs`.

Each page now requires a list similar to the following at top of page in the Jekyll variable declaration:

```yaml
breadcrumbs:
- title: Home
  url: /home.html
- title: Test
  url: /home/test.html
```

In the `docs/_includes/breadcrumbs.html` file, I have added a guard condition for the existence of the `breadcrumbs` variable before generating the breadcrumbs list.

The choice of `title` and `url` as names of elements matches their usage throughout other Jekyll code.

## Additional Page Division

Some pages have a table of contents. An example can be found at [2020-01-02 Upgrade to Python3 for Ansible](https://dfhawthorne.github.io/home/system-builds/auburn/2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html). The HTML code for this TOC is:

```html
<div class="goog-toc sites-embed-toc-maxdepth-6">
  <p>Contents</p>
  <ol class="goog-toc">
    <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Overview"><strong>1</strong> Overview</a></li>
    <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-References"><strong>2</strong> References</a></li>
    <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Procedure"><strong>3</strong> Procedure</a>
    <ol class="goog-toc">
      <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-First-Attempt-to-Install-Python3-Version-of-Ansible"><strong>3.1</strong> First Attempt to Install Python3 Version of Ansible</a></li>
      <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Install-Pip3"><strong>3.2</strong> Install Pip3</a></li>
      <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Second-Attempt-to-Install-Python3-Version-of-Ansible"><strong>3.3</strong> Second Attempt to Install Python3 Version of Ansible</a></li>
      <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Verify-Installation"><strong>3.4</strong> Verify Installation</a></li>
      <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Uninstall-and-Re-install-Ansible"><strong>3.5</strong> Uninstall and Re-install Ansible</a></li>
      <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Find-All-Versions-of-Ansible"><strong>3.6</strong> Find All Versions of Ansible</a></li>
      <li class="goog-toc"><a href="2020-01-02-upgrade-to-python3-for-ansible.html#TOC-Logoff-and-Logon"><strong>3.7</strong> Logoff and Logon</a></li>
    </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
```

I propose that this structure be encoded with the following YAML structure:

```yaml
table-of-contents:
- toc-url: Overview
  toc-text: Overview
- toc-url: References
  toc-text: References
- toc-url: Procedure
  toc-text: Procedure
  toc-menu:
  - toc-url: First-Attempt-to-Install-Python3-Version-of-Ansible
    toc-text: First Attempt to Install Python3 Version of Ansible
  - toc-url: Install-Pip3
    toc-text: Install Pip3
  - toc-url: Second-Attempt-to-Install-Python3-Version-of-Ansible
    toc-text: Second Attempt to Install Python3 Version of Ansible
  - toc-url: Verify-Installation
    toc-text: Verify Installation
  - toc-url: Uninstall-and-Re-install-Ansible
    toc-text: Uninstall and Re-install Ansible
  - toc-url: Find-All-Versions-of-Ansible
    toc-text: Find All Versions of Ansible
  - toc-url: Logoff-and-Logon
    toc-text: Logoff and Logon
```

The table of contents is generated by `docs/_includes/table_of_contents.html` and is styled by `docs/_sass/_table_of_contents.scss`. I had considered calling these files, `contents`, but this was too close to the Jekyll variable, `content`.
