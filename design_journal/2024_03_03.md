# 2024-03-03: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Deeper Analysis of Web Pages

## Summary

I have redesigned the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, to do a deeper analysis of the web page in order to handle differing combinations of TOC, sub-page menus, and displayable content.

## Table of Contents

* [Issues](#issues)
  * [11: Site Map not working correctly](#11-site-map-not-working-correctly)
  * [32: Empty Sub-Pages Menu Found](#32-empty-sub-pages-menu-found)

## Issues

### 11: Site Map not working correctly

Issue [11](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/11) reports that validation of Google Search is still in progress.

### 32: Empty Sub-Pages Menu Found

Resolution of issue [34](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/34) also resolved this issue [32](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/32) (_Empty Sub-Pages Menu Found_).

### 34: Pages with TOC and Sub-Pages Fail to be Converted Correctly

Updated the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, to decode the structure of the input HTML file into four (4) elements:

1. Prologue (displayable text at start of main content)
1. TOC (Table of Contents)
   - optional `div` tag with a class of `sites-embed-toc-maxdepth-6`
1. Sub-pages Menu
   - optional `div` with an `ID` of `sites-toc-undefined`
1. Epilogue (displayable text after optional elements)

The TOC is not converted to YAML format if either:

1. There is displayable text preceding the TOC entries (prologue)
1. There are multiple TOCs found

`home/11g-oce-rac.html` was successfully converted. Issue [34](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/34) has been resolved.

## Changes to Conversion Script

I made several other changes to the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`:

- Moved removal of empty `DIV` tags towards the end of the script after all other adjustments to the web content.
- Remove content if it only consists of '`<div><br/></div>`'.
- All title YAML elements now have their values enclosed in single quotes in order to accomodate strings with embedded isolated dashes.
- The sub-page menu within the sub-pages widget is detected as an `UL` tag with an attribute of '`jotid="navList"`'
