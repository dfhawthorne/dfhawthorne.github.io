# 2024-05-10: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Conversion of File Download Widget

## Summary

25 pages with the File Download widget were converted. Two (2) other pages only had images in the File Download widget. These latter pages had the widget removed.

Also, all of the SCSS files were consolidated as `docs/_sass/_wiki.scss`. This allowed to rationalise the CSS attributes.

## New Page Layout

The page layout is now:

Row | Column 1 | Column 2
---: | --- | ---
1 | Banner | Banner
2 | `NAV` | `HEADER`
3 | `NAV` | `MAIN`
4 | `NAV` | `FOOTER`
5 | `NAV` | (empty)

* [2024-01-29](2024_01_29.md#enhancements-to-home-page-layout)

This new layout allows for the inclusion of extra elements without the need to shuffle other elements around.

The empty fifth row allows for short pages. That is, pages with content shorter than the side navigation bar do show a large amount of white page in the middle of the page.

The use of the inline grid in the `HEADER` element prevents the overlap of the search bar and the table of contents.
