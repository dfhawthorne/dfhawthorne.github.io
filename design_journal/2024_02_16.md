## Cleaned Up Announdements

I removed a reference to "`.png.html`" in `docs/announcements.html` by deleting the following code:

```html
 <div style="display:block;text-align:left">
   <img border="0" src="announcements/OCM_ODb11gAdmin_clr.gif.html"/>
 </div>
```

The other page referencing "`announcements/OCM_ODb11gAdmin_clr.gif.html`" is `announcements/12march2012.html`.

```bash
git rm docs/announcements/OCM_ODb11gAdmin_clr.gif.html
```

## Changes to Convert Web Pages Script

### Extra Option

I added an extra option, `-g` or `--git-remove`, that requests that the script uses GIT to remove any of the following files that are encountered in the source web page:

1. `*.png.html`
1. `*.gif.html`
1. `*attredirects=0`

Needs helper routines (`normalise_url` and `need_to_remove_url`) to examine the complexities of the `href` or `src` attributes.

This option requires the `subprocess` module to run the command to remove the files from GIT.

### Improved Comments for the Path Variables

Added the following comment block:

```text
# Locate the input file within:
# (1) documents base which is a sibling of the scripts directory (doc_base)
# (2) relative directory to where the script is invoked from (page_rel_url)
# (3) the whole file system (curr_dir)
#
# Change the working directory to where the input file is located. This is
# necessary as Classic Google Sites pages use page-relative URLs.
```

### Add Auxiliary Function to Normalise URL

I added an auxiliary function, `normalise_url`, with one (1) parameter, `href`.

The comment block is:

```text
# Auxiliary function to convert URL into one relative to the base of the Wiki
# (1) Remove prefixes of the form
#     - http://dfhawthorne.github.io/'
#     - https://dfhawthorne.github.io/'
#     - http://sites.google.com/view/yetanotherocm/'
#     - https://sites.google.com/view/yetanotherocm/'
# (2) Convert relative paths from the current page to the documents base
# (3) Leave other URLs unchanged
# (4) Change URL encoding: %2F to '?'
```

### Add Auxiliary Function to Determine if URL needs to be Removed

I added an auxiliary function, `need_to_remove_url`, with one (1) parameter, `url`.

The comment block is:

```text
# Auxiliary function to determine if the file referenced by a URL needs to be
# removed. The following suffixes are considered for removal:
# - .png.html
# - .gif.html
# - attredirects=0
```

### Improved Removal of Empty DIV Tags

Strings are stripped before considering empty DIV tags.

## New Script to Find Unconverted Web Pages

I wrote a script, `scripts/find_unconverted_web_pages.sh`, to find unconverted web pages. It is substantial similar to `scripts/find_converted_web_pages.sh`.

I decided against modifying the latter script because the addition of an option would require renaming the script. The addition of the option would have determined whether the script was listing converted or unconverted web pages.
