### 83: Conversion of System Builds Wiki pages to Jekyll format

During the conversion of the Build Wiki pages for `CRONULLA`, I encountered the following issues:

* [88: CRONULLA System Build Journal - Mismatch between title and file names](#88-cronulla-system-build-journal---mismatch-between-title-and-file-names)
* [89: Journal links are missing from CRONULLA System Build Pages](#89-journal-links-are-missing-from-cronulla-system-build-pages)

### 88: CRONULLA System Build Journal - Mismatch between title and file names

I raised this issue [#88](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/88) because there was a serious mismatch between the title of a page and its file name. For example,

```yaml
- title: '2014-03-03 Design'
  url: home/system-builds/cronulla/00-design.html
```

Should be:

```yaml
- title: '2014-03-03 Design'
  url: home/system-builds/cronulla/2014-03-03-design.html
```

I decided to defer this issue to V2R8 because the functionality was not impacted.

### 89: Journal links are missing from CRONULLA System Build Pages

I raised this issue [#89](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/89) because journal links were missing from the converted `CRONULLA` system build pages.

This issue was caused by the conversion script, `script/convert_web_page.py`, not appending the extracted scroll bar YAML snippet to the page header.

This issue has been resolved.

### 90: Web Page has JAVASCRIPT:VOID(0) in URLs

I raised this issue [#90](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/90) because there are links in the page, `docs/home/system-builds/cronulla/17-upgrade-bip.html`, that point to `javascript:void(0)`.

The links are all outside of the Wiki:

```html
<li>
  <a href="javascript:void(0);">
  OracleÂ® Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Advanced Installation and Configuration Guide 12c Release 4 (12.1.0.4)
  </a>
</li>
<ul>
  <li>
  <a href="javascript:void(0);">
    15 Configuring BI Publisher with Enterprise Manager
  </a>
  </li>
  <ul>
  <li>
    <a href="javascript:void(0);">
    15.4 Upgrade Configuration of BI Publisher in Enterprise Manager 12c Release 4 (12.1.0.4)
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

This issue has been deferred to V2R8 because the page was corrected correctly.

### 91: 06-install-oms-12-1-0-3-1-again/06_Install_Step_06.png: empty

I raised this issue [#91](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/91) because an image (`docs/home/system-builds/cronulla/06-install-oms-12-1-0-3-1-again/06_Install_Step_06.png`) was empty. Fortunately, the New Google Sites version has the full image. This issue is now resolved as I used the New Google Sites version of this image.

### 92: Images appear in File Downloads Widget

I raised this issue [#92](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/92) because images are listed in the _Files Download_ widget. Although the affected web pages were converted correctly, I think these entries should be removed from the widget. As such, I have deferred this issue to V2R8.

### 93: GIT MV destination file already exists

I raised this issue [#93](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/93) because the generated `git mv` commands fail as the destination file already exists.

This was caused by an incomplete rollback of a previous conversion attempt. The issue was fixed by a `git rm` followed by a `git add`:

```bash
cd docs
git rm 'home/system-builds/cronulla/13-patch-oms-to-12-1-0-3-2/13 Patch OMS.log?attredirects=0&d=1'
git add 'home/system-builds/cronulla/13-patch-oms-to-12-1-0-3-2/13 Patch OMS.log'
```

This gives a GIT status of:

```text
renamed:    home/system-builds/cronulla/13-patch-oms-to-12-1-0-3-2/13 Patch OMS.log?attredirects=0&d=1 -> home/system-builds/cronulla/13-patch-oms-to-12-1-0-3-2/13 Patch OMS.log
```

The issue is now closed.
