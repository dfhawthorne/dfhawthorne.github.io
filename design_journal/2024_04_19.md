## Summary

There were several conversion issues encountered with System Build Journal. The main issue was with the inclusion of Jinja2 code.

## Issues

### 90: Web Page has JAVASCRIPT:VOID(0) in URLs

I added the missing URLs to replace the `JAVASCRIPT:VOID(0)` links in `docs/home/system-builds/cronulla/17-upgrade-bip.html`. The section numbering had changed from 15 to 14 over the years.

I am leaving this issue ([#90](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/90)) open to catch any futher occurrences.

### 94: TOC not converted for 2017-08-01-convert-to-xen

I opened issue [#94](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/94) because the journal scroll links were in a plain `DIV` tag.

I managed to bypass the issue by editing the affected pages by adding `style="display:grid"` to the unadorned `DIV` tags that enclose the journal scroll bars.

### 95: 502 Bad Gateway

I raised issue [#95](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/95) because a link returned `502 Bad Gateway` for a 12.1 patch README. I have deferred this issue to V2R8 because Oracle Support has now password-protected these links for archived products. The conversion of the web page was still successful. What to do about these old links is something I want to defer until the end of the project.

### 96: URL: Neither '/15-apply-psu-11-2-0-4-3-to-repos' or '/15-apply-psu-11-2-0-4-3-to-repos.html' exist

I raised issue [#95](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/95) because the conversion of `docs/home/system-builds/gridctrl/16-apply-psu-11-2-0-4-5-to-repos.html` raised the following error message:

```text
URL: Neither '/15-apply-psu-11-2-0-4-3-to-repos' or '/15-apply-psu-11-2-0-4-3-to-repos.html' exist
```

I manually corrected the URL in the source page and reran the conversion successfully.

### 97: docs/home/system-builds/redfern/2018-03-01-ansible-playbook-for-oracle-directories.html incorrectly converted

The Jekyll errors were reported:

```text
Liquid Exception: Liquid error (line 115): undefined variable item in home/system-builds/redfern/2018-03-01-ansible-playbook-for-oracle-directories.html
             Error: Liquid error (line 115): undefined variable item
             Error: Run jekyll build --trace for more information.
```

The cause is the following snippet in the main content:

```yaml
  tasks:
  - name: Creating the Oracle Home and Oracle Base Directory
    file:
      path: /opt/{{ item }}
      owner: oracle
      group: oinstall
```

[Outputting Literal curly braces in Liquid templates](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3330979/outputting-literal-curly-braces-in-liquid-templates) suggests using [raw](http://rubydoc.info/gems/liquid/Liquid/Raw). The snippet was changed to:

```yaml
  tasks:
  - name: Creating the Oracle Home and Oracle Base Directory
    file:
    {% raw %}
      path: /opt/{{ item }}
    {% endraw %}
      owner: oracle
      group: oinstall
```

The pages affected are those with curly braces:

* `docs`
  * `home`
    * `system-builds`
      * `redfern`
        * `2015-04-06-build-redfern1-on-victoria.html`
        * `2015-04-06-build-redfern2-on-victoria.html`
        * `2018-02-28-ansible-playbook-for-gi-12-1-0-2-install.html`
        * `2018-03-01-ansible-playbook-for-oracle-directories.html`
        * `2018-03-02-ansible-playbook-for-oracle-user.html`
        * `2018-03-06-ansible-playbook-for-gi-network.html`
        * `2018-03-07-ansible-playbook-for-gi-storage.html`
        * `2018-03-11-ansible-playbook-for-asmlib-setup.html`
        * `2018-03-15-ansible-roles.html`
        * `2018-03-17-ansible-playbook-to-install-gi-software.html`
        * `2018-03-20-ansible-playbook-for-install-gi-software-2.html`
        * `2018-03-24-ansible-rearrange-variables.html`

A better way is to enclose the whole content within the following tags:

```html
<!-- {% raw %} -->
...
<!-- {% endraw %} -->
```

The conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, has been updated to enclose the content as above. The issue [#97](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/97) is now closed.

## Updated Page Layout

I moved the breadcrumbs up to row 2 in order to improve the aesthetics of the page. The page layout is now:

The default page layout is now:

| Row | Column 1 | Column 2 |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | banner | banner |
| 2 | navigation | breadcrumbs |
| 3 | navigation | page title |
| 4 | navigation | search box |
| 5 | navigation | top scroll bar |
| 6 | navigation | table of contents |
| 7 | navigation | content |
| 8 | navigation | sub pages menu |
| 9 | navigation | bottom scroll bar |
| 10 | navigation | footer |

The previous layout was described on [2024-03-08](2024_03_08.md#updated-page-layout).

## Conversion Script Changes

The following changes were made to the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`:

1. URLs are first converted to be relative to the Wiki base
1. Detect and convert the Journal Scroll Bar if it exists
1. Analyse content after removal of optional scroll bar
