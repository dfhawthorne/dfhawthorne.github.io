# 2024-02-07: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Alignment to a Single Base

## Summary

With the design design to use the `<base>` HTML tag, I need to adjust image and links to reflect a single root.

## Changes to Conversion Script

The following changes were made to the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`:

1. Determination of the website base based on the location of the script.
1. Added an option, `--log`, for separating verbose output from other messages.

### Determination of the Website Base

The assumption is that the `docs` and `scripts` directories are siblings.

I used the variable, `doc_base`, to better describe its contents. This variable contains the absolute path to the root directory of the Wiki directory tree, `docs`. It is determined as `../../docs` from where the conversion script is stored. This avoids the potential bug identified in yesterday's [design journal entry](2024_02_06.md).

### Added Soft Link to ~/bin

Because of the complexity of the website directory structure, I decided to add a soft link to the conversion script as follows:

```bash
ln -s /home/douglas/git-repositories/dfhawthorne.github.io/scripts/convert_web_page.py ~/bin/convert_web_page.py
```

This required the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, to get the real path to its location in order to determine the base of the Wiki directory tree.

### Variable Names

The variable, `page_rel_url`, is the relative path of the current web page to the root of the Wiki directory tree as stored in `doc_base`.

The variable, `url_prefix`, is used to adjust the links in `<img>` and `<a>` tags from relative to the current page to the root of the Wiki directory tree.

### Logging to File

An option, `-l` or `--logging`, is added to send verbose output to a file. The default is STDOUT.

## Rearrangement of Web Page

The contents portion is moved up to before the sub-pages portion. The sub-pages portion is now styled to be in row 7.

The sub-pages portion can now have two (2) levels:

```yaml
sub-pages-title:
sub-pages:
- title:
  url:
  sub-sub-pages:
  - title:
    url:
```

The conversion script needs to be updated to produce this structure.

## Further Modifications

The following web pages have been modified:

1. `docs/announcements.html`
1. `docs/home/issues.html`
1. `docs/home/issues/cloud-control-issues/cloud-control-not-starting-automatically-in-ovm_em12r2.html`
