# 2024-04-06: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Conversion of 12C OCM Pages Started

## Summary

The conversion of the 12C OCM pages has started. The increased complexity of these pages has exposed bugs in the conversion script (`scripts/convert_web_page.py`). The main bug was the inconsistent use of file names within the script: fully-qualified names; relative names; quoted and unquoted names. Internally used file names are now unquoted, fully-qualified ones.

### 71: Embedded Sub-Pages Widget Found

This issue ([#71](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/71)) was raised for the following page:

* `docs/home/12c-ocm/data-guard.html`

This issue was closed as a duplicate of '[#33 Embedded Sub-Pages Menus Found](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/33)'.

### 73: Breadcrumbs incorrect for 12C-OCM Pages

This issue ([#73: Breadcrumbs incorrect for 12C-OCM Pages](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/73)) was caused by the resolution of issue [#24](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/24) (Investigate Duplicate 12C OCM Pages).

The breadcrumbs reference `12-ocm` instead of `12c-ocm`.

The conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, was updated to change the extracted URL from the bread crumbs from `/12-ocm` to `/12c-ocm` (the trailing slash is omitted to allow matching of the anchor page, `12-ocm.html`).

### 74: Images are missing for docs/home/12c-ocm/data-and-performance-management/configure-the-oracle-database-resource-manager.html

This issue ([#74: Images are missing for docs/home/12c-ocm/data-and-performance-management/configure-the-oracle-database-resource-manager.html](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/74)) was caused by the resolution of issue [#24](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/24) (Investigate Duplicate 12C OCM Pages).

The image sources reference `12-ocm` instead of `12c-ocm`.

The conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`, was updated to change the extracted URL from the `<IMG>` tag from `/12-ocm/` to `/12c-ocm/` through the `normalise_url` function.

### 75: Images are missing for docs/home/12c-ocm/data-and-performance-management/create-sql-plan-baselines.html

This issue ([#75](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/75)) was resolved by issue [#74](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/74).

### 76: 12C OCM Data Guard Pages: convert_web_page.py fails with "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'children'"

This issue ([76: 12C OCM Data Guard Pages: convert_web_page.py fails with "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'children'"](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/76)) occurs when the content is NONE.

This issue was resolved by adding guard condition for ensuring that the content is not NONE before referring to it.

The alternative solution of adding dummy content was rejected because the solution does address the underlying problems in the code which assumed that the content was always not NONE.

### 77: Images are missing for docs/home/12-ocm/general-database-and-network-administration-and-backup-strategy/create-and-manage-pluggable-databases

This issue ([#77](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/77)) was resolved by issue [#74](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/74).

### 78: Conversion of create-pdb-using-dbca-simple.html failed with missing files

This issue ([#78](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/78)) was resolved by This issue [#79](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/79).

### 79: Incorrect Files are Being Scheduled for Deletion

This issue ([#79](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/79)) was resolved by ensuring that all file names within the conversion script (internal file names) are fully qualified and unquoted. This avoids the logical bugs of comparing fully-qualified file names with relative ones, and quoted files names with unqouted ones.

### 80: Unable to Run GIT RM under Conversion Script

For some reason, the use of `subprocess.run` to call GIT commands fails. The same command entered through a console works without a problem.

In order to continue with the Wiki conversion, I decided to put in a work-around of echoing the GIT commands to STDOUT so that I can run them later.

This issue will be carried over into the next release.

## Conversion Script Changes

There were several major changes to the conversion script, `scripts/convert_web_page.py`:

1. Use of `html.unescape` was found not to convert codes such as '%3F'.
1. '/12-ocm/' is replaced with '/12c-ocm/' in all URI.
1. `subprocess` module is no longer needed as GIT commands have to be run manually.
1. All internal file names are fully-qualified and unquoted.
1. Targets of renaming (GIT MV) are logged to STDERR if the targets already exist.
1. All file names in a GIT MV command are now quoted.
1. Sources of renaming (GIT MV) are dropped from the list of removals.
1. All GIT commands are echoed to STDOUT
