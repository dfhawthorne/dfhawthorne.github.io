# 2024-05-26: Implementation of Rebuilding of Subpages Menu

## Summary

I changed the implementation of `scripts/rebuild_subpages_menu.py` by using `docs/_data/navigation.yml` for the source of the data for building the sub-pages menu.

In future, I will have to run these scripts in the following order whenever I add a page to my Wiki:

1. `scripts/build_nav_data.py`
1. `scripts/rebuild_subpages_menu.py`

The main reason for choosing this implementation is the complexity of navigating the site map especially with the co-existence of HTML and Markdown files.
