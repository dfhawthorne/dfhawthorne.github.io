# 2024-04-30: Conversion of Wiki to Jekyll - Cronulla Build Journal

## Summary

I updated the project schedule by adding a new milestone. I partially resolved issue [#88](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/88) by updating the page titles, and renaming the latest entry to one with a sequence number prefix.

## Table of Contents

* [Project Schedule Change](#project-schedule-change)
* [Issues](#issues)
  * [17: Add individual keywords for each web page](#17-add-individual-keywords-for-each-web-page)
  * [88: CRONULLA System Build Journal - Mismatch between title and file names](#88-cronulla-system-build-journal---mismatch-between-title-and-file-names)

## Project Schedule Change

I have added a new milestone, [V2R9](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/milestone/13), to add keywords to the web pages. I think that this will be a considerable amount of work as I have a vague idea of what keywords should be added. I will need to learn more about [SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide).

I have added a month to the schedule with an expected completion date of 31 August 2024. As I am currently two (2) months of schedule, this means the effective completion date is 30 June 2024.

## Issues

### 17: Add individual keywords for each web page

This issue, [#17](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/17), has been moved the new milestone, [V2R9](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/milestone/13). This issue may not be completed depending how successful I am with SEO.

### 88: CRONULLA System Build Journal - Mismatch between title and file names

In issue [#88](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/88), I had intended to convert the file names to match the dates in the titles. However, the ordering of the files by sequence number and dates were inconsistent as __highlighted__ below:

| `22-replace-omr.html` | `2015-10-10-replace-omr.html` |

I cannot determine the origin of the dates used in the page titles. Best to revert to sequence numbers, and convert the last file name to a sequence number.

I made a partial resolution to this issue by manually editing the titles of each file and by renaming the latest file to #23.
