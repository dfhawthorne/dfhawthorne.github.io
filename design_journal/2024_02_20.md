## Summary

I have resolved the issue of hanging BigBlog links by repointing them to a custom 404 page.

## Table of Contents

## Issues

### 11: Site Map not working correctly

The issue ([11 Site Map not working correctly](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/11)) may need to fixed in order for Google Search index my Wiki correctly.

### 13: Add Search Function using Google

After about a day, the Google Search console has not yet indexed my Wiki. One reason cited is the absence of a site map.

This issue ([13 Add Search Function using Google](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/13)) may need the resolution of [11 Site Map not working correctly](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/11) for its own resolution.

### 25: Remove Residual Links to BigBlog

I had created a custom 404 page called `docs/home/10g-ocm/missing-bigblog-links.html`.

All of the identified web pages have been converted and the links to BigBlog have been adjusted as needed.

Issue [25](https://github.com/dfhawthorne/dfhawthorne.github.io/issues/25) has been closed.
