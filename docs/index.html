<h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>This Wiki grew out of my study for the Oracle Certified Master (OCM) 10G Exam. I had originally recorded my knowledge in a blog, but the search facility for that blogging platform was too slow to be useful. The Wiki format proved to be more suitable for my needs.</p>
  <p>Since then, the Wiki has been exepanded to cover the 11G and 12C OCM Upgrade Exams as well as other Oracle RDBMS certifications. Once the OCM 23C Exam is released, I will record my study notes in this Wiki.</p>
<h2>Description of Contents</h2>
  <h3>Exam Topics</h3>
    <p>The heart of this Wiki is arranged around the various certification exams. Each exam has its own documentation sub-tree with the anchor page is a summary of exam topics with my self-assessment on a scale of one (1) to five (5). One (1) is assigned to topics that I have no knowledge, and five (5) is assigned to topics that I am very comfortable with.</p>
  <h3>Build Journals</h3>
    <p>I recorded the progress of builds for various as journals within this Wiki. Exam-specific builds are recorded under the various exam sub-trees. Build journals for common systems under recorded under <a href="home/system-builds.html">System Builds</a>.</p>
