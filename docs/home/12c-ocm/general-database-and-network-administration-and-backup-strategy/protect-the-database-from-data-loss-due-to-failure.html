   <p>
    Typically, the following situations call for flashback features or point-in-time recovery:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A user error or corruption removes needed data or introduces corrupted data. For example, a user or DBA might erroneously delete or update the contents of one or more tables, drop database objects that are still needed during an update to an application, or run a large batch update that fails midway.
    </li>
    <li>
     A database upgrade fails or an upgrade script goes awry.
    </li>
    <li>
     A complete database recovery after a media failure cannot succeed because you do not have all of the needed redo logs or incremental backups.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    In these situations, you can use point-in-time recovery or flashback features to return the database or database object to its state at a previous point in time.

     <p>
      Without block media recovery, if even a single block is corrupt, then you must take the data file offline and restore a backup of the data file. You must apply all redo generated for the data file after the backup was created. The entire file is unavailable until media recovery completes. With block media recovery, only the blocks actually being recovered are unavailable during the recovery.

     physical corruption
    </a>
    problems that involve a small, well-known number of blocks. Block-level data loss usually results from intermittent, random I/O errors that do not cause widespread data loss, and memory corruptions that are written to disk. Block media recovery is not intended for cases where the extent of data loss or corruption is unknown and the entire data file requires recovery. In such cases, data file media recovery is the best solution.
