<p>
                     The All-in-One configuration is the most straightforward configuration. This configuration is made up of the server pool master, utility server, and VM Server all residing on the same VM Server. This configuration functions well for either the VM Server farm where there is only a single or a few servers or the configuration where many virtual machines are managed, but there are very few changes.

<p>
                     Installing the VM Server is a very straightforward process. Mostly this is because Oracle VM Server for x86 only supports the bare metal installation method, which means that Oracle VM is installed directly onto the hardware as you would with Linux or Windows. The idea is to install the VM Server system without very many options or customizations and then configure it later.

<p>
                     The VM Manager can very easily be hosted as a virtual machine. The hardware and software requirements are well within the parameters of what a virtual machine can provide. From a purely technical standpoint, running the VM Manager on a virtual machine makes a lot of sense. This argument holds true for OEM Grid Control as well. The most efficient way to host the Grid Control server is via a virtual machine.

                    My initial plan is to install the CLI as I will be hosting the Grid Control on the same VM cluster as the VM Manager. My understanding is that I could get the VM Manager going from DOM0, and then use the CLI to manage other VMs if I am unable to get the Grid Control VM going.

<p>
                     Consider the Xen bridge to be a switch between the virtual machine world and the outside world. If the virtual machine is configured on the correct subnet, then the switch allows traffic to flow outside of the VM Server; if a different subnet is used, traffic can only communicate within the Xen bridge. In this manner, several subnets can use this switch. However, the bridge is not a router; therefore, it does not translate from one subnet to another.
