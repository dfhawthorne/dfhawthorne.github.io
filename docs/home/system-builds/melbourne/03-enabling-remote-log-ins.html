 <blockquote>
  <p style="font-weight:bold">
   Important
  </p>
  <p>
   You should not configure remote log ins unless directed to by Oracle Support.
  </p>
  <p>
   Once secure TCP connectivity has been configured, it cannot be disabled again. There are no remote (regular) TCP connections allowed.

  <p>
