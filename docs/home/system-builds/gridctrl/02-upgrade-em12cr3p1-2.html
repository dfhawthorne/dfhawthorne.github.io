  As described in

  , I unzipped the third ZIP file successfully by using the following command:

  It would appear that I had not completed the Cloud Control 12.1.0.2.0 upgrade. According to
  <a href="home/procedures/upgrade-oracle-database/upgrade-repos-to-11-2-0-3-3-from-11-1-0-7-0-on-gridctrl.html">
   Upgrade REPOS to 11.2.0.3.3 from 11.1.0.7.0 on GRIDCTRL
  </a>
  , I have only upgraded the OMR to 11.2.0.3.4.
 </p>
 <p>
  Checking the status of the OMS, I get the following response:
 </p>
 <blockquote style="font-family:monospace">
  [oracle@gridctrl ~]$ . oraenv
  <br/>
  ORACLE_SID = [repos] ? oms
  <br/>

  So, I have an additional problem in that the OMS is not starting automatically after a reboot. I had thought I had already solved that issue as described in
  <a href="http://yaocm.wordpress.com/2010/01/04/11g-ocm-install-oem-10-2-0-5-with-new-database/" rel="nofollow">
   11G OCM Install OEM 10.2.0.5 With New Database
  </a>
  . Obviously, I did not extend the solution to the new OEM 12.1.0.1 Cloud Control.
 </p>
 <p>
  The OEM 12.1.0.2 I had created was using a VM. I had only created a workaround to solve
  <a href="home/issues/cloud-control-issues/cloud-control-not-starting-automatically-in-ovm_em12r2.html">
   Cloud Control Not Starting Automatically in OVM_EM12R2
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I only have 12.1.0.1.0 installed, I cannot directly upgrade the OMS to 12.1.0.3.0p1, without installing bundle patch 1 first as described in
  <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24628_01/upgrade.121/e22625/overview_upg_approaches.htm#CIHCDHHA" rel="nofollow">
   2.1 Upgrading 12c Release 1 (12.1.0.1) [with Bundle Patch 1], 12c Release 2 (12.1.0.2) to 12c Release 3 (12.1.0.3)

  .

  Unfortunately, Bundle Patch 1 is a horror to install. The best approach would probably be to uninstall EM12CR1 and do a fresh installation of EM12CR3p1.
