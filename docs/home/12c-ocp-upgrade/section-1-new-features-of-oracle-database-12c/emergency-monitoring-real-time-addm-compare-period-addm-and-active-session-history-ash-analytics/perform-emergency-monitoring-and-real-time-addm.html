<h2 id="TOC-overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Both Real Time ADDM and Emergency Monitoring are accessed through the Performance menu of the database home page in OEM.</p>
<p>The general procedure is to use Emergency Monitoring first in order to confirm that there is a problem with the database instance and to get a general idea of what the problem is. For a more detailed analysis, use Real Time ADDM to specific advice on resource usage or hang analysis.</p>
<p>The database instance will invoke Real Time ADDM itself if certain thresholds are breached.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-procedure">Procedure</h2>
<h3 id="TOC-generate-a-real-time-addm-report-using-sql-plus">Generate a Real Time ADDM Report Using SQL*Plus</h3>
<p>I used the following SQL*Plus commands to generate a Real Time ADDM report using the REAL_TIME_ADDM_REPORT Function. The report was supposed to be attached as <span class="file-name">report.xml</span>, but was lost during web-site conversion:</p>
<pre class="sql-cmd">SET LONG 9999
SET PAGESIZE 100
SET LINESIZE 180
COLUMN report FORMAT a180
SELECT
    dbms_addm.real_time_addm_report() AS report
  FROM
    dual;</pre> 
<h3 id="TOC-simulate-performance-problem">Simulate Performance Problem</h3>
<p>I will simulate the performance problem by running the <a href="https://github.com/dfhawthorne/sql-ocm12c/blob/master/Data%20and%20performance%20management/Configure%20the%20Resource%20Manager/stress_test.sh" class="file-name">stress_test.sh</a> on PADSTOW. (For further details, please refer to "<a href="https://yaocm.wordpress.com/2019/12/17/high-cpu-usage-with-a-cdb-resource-plan/">High CPU Usage with a CDB Resource Plan</a>".)</p>
