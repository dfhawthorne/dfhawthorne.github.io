<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>OCI provides two (2) types of DNS zones: public and private. A public DNS zone manages domain names accessible over the Internet. A private DNS zone doesn't.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-public-dns-zone">Public DNS Zone</h2>
<p>Public DNS resolver resolves DNS queries from the Internet.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-private-dns-zone">Private DNS Zone</h2>
<p>Private DNS resolvers resolves DNS queries at a subnet level. Resolvers can share views of private DNS records, or have differing DNS records.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-lab">Lab</h3>
<p>This topic is covered by <i>Lab 6-1: Networking - DNS Management: Create a Private DNS Zone</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
  <p>In this lab, you will configure a private DNS zone and create a DNS A record that corresponds to a private IP address. You will create two compute instances, one runnig Oracle Linux that will be used as a web server, and another running Microsoft windows, which will be used as a client.</p>
  <p><strong>Private DNS Zones</strong></p>
  <p>Private DNS zones contains DBS data that is accessible only from within a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). a private DNS zone has capabilities similar to an Internet DNS zone but provides responses only for clients that can reach it through a private VCN. Each zone belongs to a single view.</p>
