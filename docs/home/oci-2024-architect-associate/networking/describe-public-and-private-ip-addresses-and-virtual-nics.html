<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>There are two (2) types of subnets: private; and public. Both can have egress to the Internet. However, only the public subnet can have ingress from the Internet.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-public-and-private-ip-addresses">Public and Private IP Addresses</h2>
<p>A private IP address is always allocated. A public IP address can only exist in a public subnet.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-public-ip-address">Public IP Address</h3>
<p>A public IP address allows a resource, load balancer or instance, allows to be connected from the Internet.</p>
<p>There are two (2) types of public IP addresses which can be allocated from OCI's IPv4 allocation:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ephermal for the lifetime of the instance or load balancer</li>
  <li>Reserved exists beyond the lifetime of the resource</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="TOC-private-ip-address">Private IP Address</h3>
<p>A private IPv4 address is allocated from the subnet's CIDR.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-virtual-nics">Virtual NICs</h2>
<p>The help text for the <code>oci network vnic</code> command says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A virtual network interface card. Each VNIC resides in a subnet in a VCN. An instance attaches to a VNIC to obtain a network connection into the VCN through that subnet. Each instance has a primary VNIC that is automatically created and attached during launch. You can add secondary VNICs to an instance after it’s launched. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm">Virtual Network Interface Cards (VNICs)</a>.</p>
  <p>Each VNIC has a primary private IP that is automatically assigned during launch. You can add secondary private IPs to a VNIC after it’s created. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/PrivateIp/CreatePrivateIp">CreatePrivateIp</a> and <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm">IP Addresses</a>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you are an Oracle Cloud VMware Solution customer, you will have secondary VNICs that reside in a VLAN instead of a subnet. These VNICs have other differences, which are called out in the descriptions of the relevant attributes in the Vnic object. Also see <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Vlan">Vlan</a>.</p>
