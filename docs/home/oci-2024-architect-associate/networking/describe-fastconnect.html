<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>A FastConnect is a dedicated connection between customer premise and an OCI data centre.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.public.oneportal.content.oci.oraclecloud.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/fastconnectoverview.htm#FastConnect_Overview">FastConnect Overview</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure FastConnect provides an easy way to create a dedicated, private connection between your data center and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. FastConnect provides higher-bandwidth options, and a more reliable and consistent networking experience compared to internet-based connections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two (2) types of peering:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Private</strong> extends on-premises network to OCI using a physical connection.</li>
    <li><strong>Public</strong> allows access to public-facing resources in OCI without traffic passing the Internet.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="TOC-connectivity-models">Connectivity Models</h2>
<p>There are three (3) models for connecting to OCI using FastConnect:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Oracle Partners</strong> have an existing relationship with Oracle that allows the partner to terminate network connections within OCI data centres.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Provider</strong> require an letter of authority (LOA) to enter the OCI data centre in order to terminate a network link there by placing network equipment and links.</li>
    <li><strong>Colocation</strong> is where the customer provides their own equipment and link into an OCI data centre. A LOA is required for data center access. This works best if the customer already has a presence at the data centre.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last two (2) are called <em>FastConnect Direct</em>.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-fastconnect-overview">FastConnect</h2>
<p>FastConnect is a dedicated and private physical connection bewteen on-premises and OCI. Benefits are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>High bandwidth</li>
    <li>More reliable</li>
    <li>More consistent network experience</li>
</ul>
<p>FastConnect location is at an Oracle datacentre. A Metro area has multiple FastConnect locations within a geographical region.</p>
<p>Oracle Partners and Third Party Providers are network service providers. Oracle Partner has integrated with Oracle in a FastConnect Location.</p>
<p>Co-Location is where customer has a cage at a FastConnect location into which the customer puts their edge servers.</p>
<p>Cross-connect is the physical aspect of FastConnect, whereas virtual circuit is its logical aspect. Cross-connect is the cable that connects the customers premises with the FastConnect location. To expand capacity, a Cross-Connect Group of multiple cross-connects may be needed.</p>
<p>A virtual circuit can be public or private. Public virtual circuit allows connection to public resources in OCI without going via the Internet. Private virtual circuit requires the use of a DRG for peering between on-premises and a VCN in OCI. A virtual circuit is an isolated network path.</p>
<p>BGP session is an exchange of routing information between autonomous systems.</p>
<p>BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) verifies connectivity between devices (does not exchange routing information). BFD is used to detect failures between adjacent networks.</p>
<p>Oracle Edge consists of a physical device in an Oracle cage at a FastConnect location, and a logical device. The cross-connect is terminated by the physical device, and the virtual circuit is terminated by the logical device.</p>
<p>LOA (Letter of Authorisation) allows a third-party provider to gain access to a FastConnect location so as to lay a physical cable. LOA is also needed for co-location.</p>
<p><strong>FastConnect Direct</strong> is done through either Third-Party provider or Co-Location.</p>
<p>No egress data transfer charges.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-fastconnect-demo">FastConnect Demo</h2>
<p>Under <em>Customer Connection</em> in OCI Console, choose <em>connection type</em> from one of:</p>
<ul>
    <li>FastConnect Partner</li>
    <li>FastConnect Direct (3rd party connection or colocation) - creates LOA</li>
</ul>
<p>For FastConnect Partner,</p>
<ol>
    <li>Choose type of virtual circuit:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Private</li>
        <li>Public</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Choose type of traffic to be sent to on-premises network:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>All traffic</li>
        <li>Only IPSec traffic</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Need DRG</li>
    <li>Select provisioned bandwidth from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps</li>
    <li>BGP IP addresses</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer side (/28 to /31)</li>
        <li>Oracle side</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<h2 id="TOC-fastconnect-redundancy-best-practices">FastConnect Redundancy Best Practices</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>For FastConnect redundancy, Oracle provides</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple partners for each region</li>
<li>Multiple physical connections between each Oracle partner and Oracle (for a given region)</li>
<li>At least one FastConnect location for each region</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Need multiple edge devices spread across multiple FastConnect locations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oracle handles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redundancy of physical connection between partner and Oracle</li>
<li>Redundancy of routers in FastConnect locations</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer handles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Redundancy of physical connection between existing network and Oracle partner</li>
</ul>
