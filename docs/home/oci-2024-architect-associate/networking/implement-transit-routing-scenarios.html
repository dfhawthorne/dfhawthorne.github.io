<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>There are three (3) primary transit routing scenarios:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Access between multiple networks through a single DRG with a firewall between networks</li>
  <li>Access to multiple VCNs in the same region</li>
  <li>Private access to Oracle service</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="TOC-overview">Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/transitrouting.htm">Transit Routing inside a hub VCN</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Transit routing</i> is simply routing traffic to either a virtual cloud network (VCN) or an on-premises network through a central hub VCN. Here's a basic example of why you might use transit routing: you have a large organization with different departments, each with their own VCN. Your on-premises network needs access to the different VCNs, but you don't want the administration overhead of maintaining a secure connection from each VCN to the on-premises network. Instead you want to use a single FastConnect or Site-to-Site VPN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All three (3) scenarios use a hub-and-spoke configuration with either a DRG or a VCN as the hub. The spokes are either other VCNs or OCI services.</p>
