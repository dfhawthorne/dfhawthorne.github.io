<p>VCN connectivity can be achieved through gateways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet Gateway for egress to and ingress from the Internet to a public subnet</li>
  <li>NAT Gateway for egress to the Intermet from a private subnet</li>
  <li>Local Peering Gateway routes traffic between non-overlapping subnets in different VCNs in the same region.</li>
  <li>Dynamic Routing Gateway routes traffic between non-overlapping subnets in different VCNs in the same or different regions, or between customer premise equipment (CPE).</li>
</ul>

<p>VCN can be connected to another VCN in the same region (local peering) and different region (remote peering). Remote peering is done through DRG. Local peering can be done in one of two (2) ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>LPG: Local Peering Gateways</li>
  <li>DRG: Dynamic Routing Gateway</li>
</ol>
<p>VCN can also be connected to the on-premises network through one (1) of three (3) options:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Public Internet</li>
  <ul>
    <li>using IG or NATGW</li>
    <li>mainly for proof-of-concept</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Site-to-site VPN</li>
  <ul>
    <li>IPSec over Internet</li>
    <li>no guarantee in service quality</li>
    <li>Free service</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Fastconnect</li>
  <ul>
    <li>dedicated connection with low latency and high bandwidth up to 100 GB/sec</li>
    <li>No egress fees</li>
    <li>Only pay for hourly port charges</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
