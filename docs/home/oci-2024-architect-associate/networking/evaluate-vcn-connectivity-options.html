<p>VCN connectivity can be achieved through gateways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet Gateway for egress to and ingress from the Internet to a public subnet</li>
  <li>NAT Gateway for egress to the Intermet from a private subnet</li>
  <li>Local Peering Gateway routes traffic between non-overlapping subnets in different VCNs in the same region.</li>
  <li>Dynamic Routing Gateway routes traffic between non-overlapping subnets in different VCNs in the same or different regions, or between customer premise equipment (CPE).</li>
</ul>
