<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Block volumes can be attached to a single compute instance either as a boot volume, or to expand storage. Block volumes can be shared among up to eight (8) compute instances.</p>

<h3 id="TOC-overview-of-block-volume">Overview of Block Volume</h3>
<p>Block volume is NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory Express) SSD-based storage that is durable (outlives the compute instance). Multiple block volumes can be created, attached, and detached from a compute instance. This allows block volumes to be relocated between compute instances.</p>
<p>NVMe SSD devices can be locally attached for extremely low latency and high performance. But these devices do not outlive the compute instance.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-volume-attachment-types">Volume Attachment Types</h3>
<p>A block volume can be attached to an instance as iSCSI and paravirtualised (attached via the hypervisor).</p>
<h3 id="TOC-volume-types">Volume Access Types</h3>
<p>Up to eight (8) compute instances can connect to the same block volume either as either R/W or R/O shareable access. A cluster file system needs to installed.</p>
<p>A block volume can connected as R/W to a single compute instance.</p>
<h3 id="TOC-boot-volumes">Boot Volumes</h3>
<p>Launching a compute instance creates a new boot volume. On termination of the compute instance, the boot volume can be retained.</p>
<p>This retained boot volume can be used for future launching of compute instances, or for diagnosing boot failures by attaching the boot volume to another compute instance.</p>
