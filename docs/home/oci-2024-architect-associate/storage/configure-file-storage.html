<h2 id="TOC-lab">Lab</h2>
<p>This topic is covered by <i>Lab 14-1: File Storage: Create and Mount a File System</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
  <p>The oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) File Storage service provides robust and shareable file systems. Network access to your system is provided through a mount target, which is an NFS endpoint that lives in a subnet and connects NFS clients to file systems.</p>
  <p>In this lab, you'll learn how to create a file system with the OCI console.</p>
  <p>In this lab, you'll:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) and its components</li>
    <li>Create a VM instance</li>
    <li>Create a file system</li>
    <li>Configure VCN Security Rules for file storage</li>
    <li>Mount the file system from an instance</li>
  </ol>
