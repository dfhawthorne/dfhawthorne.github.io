<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>There are two (2) basic concepts in security:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Authentication (AuthN)</strong> identifies the person or entity attempting to access a secured resource.</li>
  <li><strong>Authorisation (AuthZ)</strong> determines what level of access a person or entity has to a secured resource.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="TOC-authentication">Authentication</h2>
<p>Authentication is the Identity part of IAM.</p>
<p>People and entities can be aythenticated through various means:</p>
<ul>
  <li>User credentials such as userid and password. This can be strengthened through MFA (Multi-factor authentication) for connection directly to OCI.</li>
  <li>Federated identity: credentials are authenticated by another service such as Microsoft AD, another cloud vendor, or another tenancy within OCI.</li>
  <li>Programs can be authenticated through API keys and OAuth 2.0 tokens. Access is still associated with a defined user within the tenancy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once a tenancy is provisioned, one (1) user is created (the tenancy administrator) and that user is part of the <i>Administrators</i> group in the <i>Default</i> identity domain.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-authorisation">Authorisation</h2>
<p>Authorisation is the Access Management part of IAM.</p>
<p>Authorisation is managed through policies. There are initially two (2) policies:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Allow all members of the <i>Administrators</i> group in the <i>Default</i> identity domain can manage all resources within the tenancy. This policy allows the tenancy administrator to create enough resources to allow the tenancy to become self-substaining by provisioning other compartments, identity domains, and administrators for those identity domains and compartments.</li>
  <li>Everything else is prohibited. This policy can not be removed. This forces administrators to explicitly allow access to resources.</li>
</ol>
