  <p><strong>Introducing Private Endpoints</strong></p>
  <p>In traditional security architectures, data tier services are deployed deep inside the customer private network with many layers of security access control above it.</p>
  <p>Customers who migrate to the cloud want their services to ubiquitously accessible from their private network.</p>
  <p><strong>Private Endpoints</strong></p>
  <img src="home/oci-2024-certified-networking-professional/design-and-deploy-oci-virtual-cloud-networks-vcn/demonstrate-mastery-in-applying-endpoints-to-a-networking-architecture/private-endpoints.png" />
  <p>Private endpoints (PE) is an evolution of the private connectivity model whereby customers access Oracle services over a private IP allocated from a private subnet within their VCN.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In this setup, the VCN CIDRs are advertised to the on-premises network by the DRG using BGP.</li>
    <li>The DRG routes the inbound traffic that is from the on-premises network and destined for the PE that represents a supported Oracle service.</li>
    <p>Traffic destined to the PE is tunneled directly to the supported Oracle service.</p>
    <p>Private endpoints provide the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extended private connectivity</li>
      <li>Enhanced security</li>
      <li>Seamless service integration</li>
      <li>Simplified management</li>
      <li>Reverse connection, proxy services (DNS, SCAN)</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Reverse Connection Endpoints</strong></p>
  <img src="home/oci-2024-certified-networking-professional/design-and-deploy-oci-virtual-cloud-networks-vcn/demonstrate-mastery-in-applying-endpoints-to-a-networking-architecture/reverse-connection-endpoints.png" />
  <p>A set of services require Service to Consumer (S2C) private connectivity to initiate connections back into the consumer network.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The PE reverse connection endpoints (RCE) feature allows services to connect to servers (typically data sources) in the customer's private private network.</li>
    <li>Reverse connections is an optional feature of PE</li>
    <li>In case a service requires only the RCE feature, a forward connection private endpoint is still provisioned.</li>
    <li>RCE introduces new constructs:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>DNS Proxy: Pseudo-DNS resolver</li>
      <li>SCAN Proxy: Proxy to handle SCAN protocol</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Service Gateway Versus PE</strong></p>
