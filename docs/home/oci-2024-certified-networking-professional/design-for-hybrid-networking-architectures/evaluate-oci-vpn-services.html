<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Secure connectivity from on-premises to OCI</dt>
<dd>Securely connect your existing infrastructure to the cloud</dd>
<dt>Connect multiple locations to the cloud</dt>
<dd>Connect your headquarters, branch locations, and private data centers to OCI so all of your offices can access applications directly.</dd>
<dt>Build redundant connectivity for FastConnect</dt>
<dd>Already have Oracle FastConnect? Site-to-Site IPSec VPN can provide a redundant connection to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure</dd>
<dt>Use for Proof of Concept</dt>
<dd>No contracts or commitment. Build as many VPN tunnels to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as desired and decide how long you want them active.</dd>

<h3 id="TOC-site-to-site-vpn-redundancy-overview">Site-to-Site VPN: Redundancy Overview</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>OCI provisions redundant IPSec VPN tunnels located on physically and logically diverse tunnel endpoints in the same region.</li>
<li>Routing type can be configured per tunnel. It is higly recommended to use the same routing type for all tunnels.</li>
<li>Use routing to configure active/passive or active/active tunnels and failover behaviour</li>
<li>By default, redundancy is provided only on the Oracle end. Customers must ensure end-to-end redundancy by configuring redundant tunnels to 1 or more CPEs, and 1 or more Internet providers.</li>
</ul>

<dt>BGP Local Preference</dt>
<dd>Configure on CPE to influence traffic egressing on-premises</dd>
<dt>BGP AS PATH Prepending</dt>
<dd>Use prepending when advertising routes to OCI to influence which tunnel has the shortest path for any given route. Oracle will use the shortest AS PATH as a tiebreaker when sending traffic to on-premises</dd>

<h3 id="TOC-site-to-site-vpn-negotiation-behaviour">Site-to-Site VPN: Negotiation, Behaviour</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Participants authenticate the IPSec peer and a secure channel to negotiate the IPSec Security Associations (SA). The outcome of a Phase 1 negotiation is the IKE SA (Phase 1 SA)</li>
<li>Phase 2: Using keying material derived from the Pahse 1 negotiation, participants negotiate IPSec SAs (Phase 2 SA) which will specify what traffic to send over the VPN and how to encrypt/authenticate the traffic.</li>
<li>When traffic is routed to a VPN, a SA lookeup is performed before encrypting traffic.</li>
<li>A similar method is performed for an icoming packet.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="TOC-policy-based-and-route-based-vpns">Policy-Based and Route-BAsed VPNs</h3>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>CPE configuration mechanism. Different with each vendor. Some vendors may support both methods.</li>
<li>The main difference is the encryption decision.</li>
<li>Policy based</li>
<ul>
<li>A subset of traffic flowing through an interface is encrypted according to a specific policy.</li>
<li>A special policy is used to determine whether specific traffic is sent across a VPN tunnel.</li>
<li>An IPSec SA is created for each source/destination policy combination. This may also be referred to as an encryption domain.</li>
<li>Each encryption domain is treated as a separate tunnel.</li>
<li>Example: 1 local subnet, 3 remote subnets = 3 IPSec SAs.</li>
</ul>
<li>Route based</li>
<ul>
<li>Uses a Virtual Tunnel Interface (VTI). Any traffic routed to the VTI is encrypted and sent to the remote VPN peer.</li>
<li>Relies on routing decisions to determine if specific is sent across a VPN tunnel.</li>
<li>A single IPSec SA is generated for each VPN tunnel.</li>
<li>Default VTI encryption domain of any/any, meaning any traffic routed to the VTI is encrypted without an additional policy lookup.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
