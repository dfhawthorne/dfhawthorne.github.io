<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>For a large and complex environment, a hub-and-spoke design with standard names and contiguous CIDR blocks with space to grow is recommended.</p>
<h2 id="TOC-network-design-best-practices">Network Design Best Practices</h2>
<p>Use best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do network design early as some design can be difficult or involve outages to change later</li>
<li>Consider the following items:</li>
<ul>
<li>Topology</li>
<li>Traffic flow</li>
<li>VCN/subnet size</li>
<li>DNS</li>
<li>Connectivity</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<h2 id="TOC-hubandspoke-design">Hub-and-Spoke Design</h2>
<p>The advantages of a hub-and-spoke design are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isolation and segmentation</li>
<li>Enables common/shared services hosted in the hub VCN</li>
<li>Higly scalable</li>
<li>Centralised security through placement of security appliances in hub VCN</li>
</ul>
<p>The following should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>How and where different environments are segmented</li>
<li>Production versus non-production</li>
<li>Different internal or external customers</li>
</ul>
<p>For a very simple or small OCI deployment, a single VCN is recommended.</p>

<p>Best practices for network design include:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Standard Naming Convention</dt>
<dd>In a large and complex environment, easy identification of resources is vital as to purpose, lifecycle, ownership, and type. A standard set of acronyms is advisable. <strong>Some resource names cannot be changed after creation.</strong></dd>
<dt>Subnet Type</dt>
<dd>The subnet type (<em>Public</em> or <em>Private</em>)cannot be changed after creation.</dd>
<dt>Size of VCNs and Subnets</dt>
<dd>For IPv4, VCNs should have a contiguous CIDR that allows for future growth in both resources and subnets.</dd>
<dt>Custom Route Tables and Security Lists</dt>
<dd>Granular routing and security for subnets lessens the chances for security holes.</dd>
