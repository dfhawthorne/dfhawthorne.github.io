<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>BYOIP moves the customer's public IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) into OCI. The regional internet registry needs to notified of the new arrangement in order to direct BGP routing away from the customer towards OCI ASN.</p>

<p>Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP) allows the customer to import public IP addresses that the customer owns into OCI for use by resources, such as load balancer listeners and compute instance public IP addresses. The customer needs to liaise with both Oralce and the Regional Internet Registry that assigned those addresses.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Migration</dt>
<dd>Hard-coded IP addresses can be migrated to OCI.</dd>
<dt>IP Pool Management</dt>

<h3 id="TOC-byoip-limits">BYOIP Limits</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can only be imported into a single region</li>

<li>Up to 20 IPv4 CIDR blocks or IPv6 prefixes or a combination to an OCI account</li>
<li>An address range can only be assigned to a single compartment</li>
<li>Can assign up to 5 IPv6 prefixes per VCN and up to one per subnet. Can assign IPv4 addresses from one prefix to a VNIC</li>

<li>Placement in a public subnet of a VCN with an Internet Gateway attached. Security rules need to be established to allow this.</li>

<h3 id="TOC-public-ip-pools">Public IP Pools</h3>
<p><cite>A public IP pool is simply a set of IPv4 CIDR blocks alocated to a tenacny. These CIDR blocks can be all or part of a BYOIP CIDR block. Public IP CIDR blocks assigned to a pool are available only for your tenancy. Public IP pools are available as a source for IP allocation when launching a NAT gateway, load balancer, or compute instance. You can add more IP CIDR blocks to a public IP pool at any time.</cite></p>

<p><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Concepts/BYOIP.htm#BYOIP__process">BYOIP Process Overview</a> shows the following overview:</p>
<img alt="Swimlane diagram for importing a BYOIP range" src="https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Images/network_byoip_swimlane.svg"/>
<p>There are seven (7) steps in the above swimlane diagram to import a BYOIP range:</p>
<ol>
<li>The customer submits a request to OCI to import either a public IPv4 CIDR block or IPv6 prefix</li>
<li>Oracle issues a verification token</li>
<li>The customer submits the verification token and the required IP address block to the Regional Internet Registry (RIR)</li>
<li>The customer negotiates a Route Origin Authorisation (ROA) with the RIR so that OCI can host the IP block/prefix</li>
<li>The customer asks OCI to complete the import process</li>
<li>Oracle assigns the IP block/prefix to the selected compartment</li>
<li>The customer then manages the BYOIP resource</li>
</ol>
