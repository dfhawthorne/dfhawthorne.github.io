<ul>
<li>A private DNS resolver allows resolution of local, internal resources that have custom domain names. The domain names do not need to be subdomains of oraclevcn.com, as with the default Internet and VCN Resolver</li>
<li>You can specify a DNS label when creating VCN and subnets and launching a host</li>
<ul>
<li>VCN Domain Name: &lt;VCN DNS label&gt;.oraclevcn.com</li>
<li>Subnet Domain Name: &lt;subnet DNS label&gt;.&lt;VCN DNS label&gt;.oraclevcn.com</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Within a VCN, always use 169.254.169.254, optionally with forwarding rules</li>
<li>Consider a dedicated subzone for resources in OCI, for example. oci.customer.co or us-phoenix-1.oci.customer.com</li>

<dd>This is the default choice. It is an Oracle-provided option that includes two parts:
      <dl>
<dt>Internet Resolver:</dt>
<dd>Lets instances resolve host names that are publicly published on the Internet</dd>
<dt>VCN Resolver:</dt>
<dd>Lets instances resolve host names (which you can assign) of other instances in the same VCN</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Custom resolver:</dt>
<dd>Use DNS servers of your choice for resolution (maximum three). They could be DNS servers that are:
      <ul>
<li>Available on the Internet, for example, 216.146.35.35 for Dyn's Internet Guide</li>
<li>In your VCN</li>
<li>In your on-premises network, which is connected to your VCN by way of FastConnect or VPN Connect (through a DRG)</li>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>Steering Policies:</dt>
<dd>A framework to define the traffic management behaviour for your zones. Steering policies contain rules that help to intelligently serve DNS answers.</dd>
<dt>Attachments:</dt>
<dd>Enables you to link a steering policy to your zones. An attachment of a steering policy to a zone occludes all records at its domain that are of a covered record type, constructing DNS responses from its steering policy rather than from those domain's records. A domain can have at most one attachment covering any given record type.</dd>
<dt>Rules:</dt>
<dd>The guidelines steering policies use to filter answers based on the properties of a DNS request, such as the geolocation of the request or the health of your endpoints.</dd>
<dt>Answers:</dt>

<p>Performance (latency) and availability are measured from <strong>Vantage Points</strong> all around the globe. Public IP addresses and FQDN are the targets for measuring. Endpoints are measured throughout OCI and the hybrid infrastructure. The measurements are down through either PING or HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Failures are handled through DNS Traffic Management to initiate failover.</p>
<!-- p.268 -->
<h3 id="TOC-http-redirects">HTTP Redirects</h3>
<p>Redirection can be achieved through either DNS ALIAS or HTTP redirect (301).</p>
