<h2 id="TOC-summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Instead of multiple virtual circuits from on-premises to VCNs, a hub (either a VCN and legacy DRG or upgraded DRG) is used to connect the VCNs with on-premises by allowing transit of traffic through the hub.</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The OCI VCN Transit Routing solution is based on the hub-and-spoke topology and anbles the hub VCN to provide transit between multiple spoke VCNs (within the OCI region) and on-premises network.</li>
<li>Transit routing can also be used to transit from one OCI region to another OCI region leveraging the OCI backbone.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="TOC-oci-transit-routing-via-lpg">OCI Transit Routing via LPG</h2>
<p>A hub VCN is connected to on-premises network through a DRG and either FastConnect or Site-to-Site VPN. This VCN could be peered with up to ten (10) other VCNs in the same region using LPGs. The traffic to/from on-premises has to transit the hub VCN to reach the target VCN.</p>
<p>For example, the route table for a subnet in a spoke VCN would be:</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Destination CIDR</th>
      <th>Route Target</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0.0.0.0/0</td>
      <td>LPG</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>That is, all traffic, that is not local to the spoke VCN, would go the LPG from the subnet in the spoke VCN.</p>
<p>The route table for the LPG would include:</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Destination CIDR</th>
      <th>Route Target</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>172.16.0.0/16</td>
      <td>DRG</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Here the CIDR, 172.16.0.0/16, is for the on-premises network.</p>
<p>The route table for the DRG would include:</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Destination CIDR</th>
      <th>Route Target</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>192.168.0.0/24</td>
      <td>LPG</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Here the CIDR, 192.168.0.0/24, is for the subnet in the spoke VCN. This alloews for return traffic from the on-premises network.</p>

<h2 id="TOC-oci-transit-routing-via-drg">OCI Transit Routing via DRG</h2>
<p>Instead of having the hub as a VCN, the hub can be the DRG that terminates a virtual circuit from on-premises. This is only available with the upgraded DRG. For earlier versions of DRG, transit routing via LPG has to be used.</p>
<!-- p.359 -->
<h2 id="TOC-oci-transit-routing-with-third-party-appliance">OCI Transit Routing with Third Party Appliance</h2>
<p>The configuration is a DRG coupled with a third-party appliance. The third-party appliance has VNICs in all spoke VCNs and the hub VCN. All transit traffic goes through this third-party appliance.</p>
<p>The third-party appliance is usually a software firewall for the inspection of network packets. The hub VCN could then be seen as a DMZ to filter untrusted traffic.</p>
<!-- p.364 -->
<h2 id="TOC-oci-transit-routing-remote-peering-connection">OCI Transit Routing, Remote Peering Connection</h2>
<p>Again the hub is a DRG that terminates a virtual circuit from on-premises. The spoke VCNs can be in different regions and tenancies. This is achieved through a remote peering connection to another DRG.</p>
