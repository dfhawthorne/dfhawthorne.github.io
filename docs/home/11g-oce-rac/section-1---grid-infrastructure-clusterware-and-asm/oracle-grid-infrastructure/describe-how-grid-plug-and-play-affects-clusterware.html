   What's New in Oracle Clusterware Administration and Deployment?

  , says that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Grid Plug and Play enables you to move your data center toward a dynamic grid infrastructure. This enables you to consolidate applications and lower the costs of managing applications, while providing a highly available environment that can easily scale when the workload requires. There are many modifications in Oracle RAC 11g release 2 (11.2) to support the easy addition of servers in a cluster and therefore a more dynamic grid.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the past, adding or removing servers in a cluster required extensive manual preparation. With this release, Grid Plug and Play reduces the costs of installing, configuring, and managing server nodes by automating the following tasks:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Adding an Oracle RAC database instance
   </li>
   <li>
    Negotiating appropriate network identities for itself
   </li>
   <li>
    Acquiring additional information it needs to operate from a configuration profile
   </li>
   <li>
    Configuring or reconfiguring itself using profile data, making host names and addresses resolvable on the network
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Additionally, the number of steps necessary to add and remove nodes is reduced.
  </p>
  <p>
   Oracle Enterprise Manager immediately reflects Grid Plug and Play-enabled changes.
