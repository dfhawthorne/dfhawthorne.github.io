  , as
  <span style="font-family:monospace">
   Panania1

  , and made the following edits:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Increased memory from 1GB to 2.1GB
  </li>
  <li>
   Changed Network Adapter from Host-only to Bridged
  </li>
  <li>
   Added two (2) Network adapters as Bridged
  </li>
  <li>
   Added a SCSI Hard Disk of 10GB (File name is

   3.1.1 Overview of Oracle Clusterware and Oracle RAC Storage Options
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   For Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) 11g release 2 (11.2) for Linux, Oracle Automatic Storage Management Cluster File System (Oracle ACFS) and Oracle ASM Dynamic Volume Manager (Oracle ADVM) are only supported in the following environments:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Red Hat and Oracle Enterprise Linux 5, 32-bit
   </li>
   <li>
    Red Hat and Oracle Enterprise Linux 5, 64-bit
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   For OVM environments, Red Hat and Oracle Enterprise Linux 5 Update 4 or later is required.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Since I had installed RHEL5.4 as part of the 11G OCM Exam practice, I will go with the current OS and get the advantage of ACFS and ADVM.

  , says that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   At least 1.5 GB of physical RAM for grid infrastructure for a cluster installations without Oracle RAC; at least 2.5 GB of physical RAM if you plan to install Oracle RAC after installing grid infrastructure for a cluster.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  So, I would aim for 2.5GB in memory but VMWare Workstation 8 advises that the maximum recommended memory is 2.1GB otherwise excessiove paging may be experienced. I went with the VMWare recommendation.

  </a>
  , says that:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   If certified Network-attached Storage (NAS) is used for Oracle RAC and this storage is connected through Ethernet-based networks, then you must have a third network interface for NAS I/O. Failing to provide three separate interfaces in this case can cause performance and stability problems under load.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  Since I am planning to use NAS as the basis for the shared file system, I would need three (3) NICs.

   <li>

 <p>
  I allocated a hard disk of 10GB to accommodate both grid infrastructure and Oracle database.
