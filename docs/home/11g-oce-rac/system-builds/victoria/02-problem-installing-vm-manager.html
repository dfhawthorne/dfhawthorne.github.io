  I have come to standstill with the creation of the VM cluster. I do not have an easy way of installing VM Manager onto a VM.
 </p>
 <h2>
  <a name="TOC-Options">
  </a>
  Options
 </h2>
 <p>
  My options seem to be:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Purchase another 64-bit machine and do a bare metal installation of OEL followed by VM Manager
  </li>
  <li>
   Install a 32-bit version of VM Manager onto a VMWare VM image
  </li>
  <li>
   Use GRIDCTRL
  </li>
  <li>
   Use XEN commands from DOM0 to create a VM image
  </li>
  <li>
   Use Cloud Computing for a temporary machine
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h3>
  <a name="TOC-Purchase-Another-Machine">
  </a>
  Purchase Another Machine
 </h3>
 <p>
  I would want to avoid option because it would delay installation by another two (2) weeks and it is an additional expense. Once I have the VM cluster up and running, there would be no need for this second machine.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <a name="TOC-Install-32-Bit-Version-of-VM-Manager">
  </a>
  Install 32 Bit Version of VM Manager
 </h3>
 <p>
  Oracle VM Manager 2.2.0 is available for x86-32 bit.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem is that I have installed VM Server 3.1.1 for x86-64 bit. I doubt if the V2 VM Manager can talk to the V3 VM Server.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have downloaded the software anyway.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <a name="TOC-Use-GRIDCTRL">
  </a>
  Use GRIDCTRL
 </h3>
 <p>
  According to
  <span style="font-style:italic">
   Oracle VM Implementation and Administration Guide
  </span>
  (p.129), the relevant Oracle Support document is
  <a href="https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocContentDisplay.jspx?id=781879.1" rel="nofollow">
   Oracle VM and Cloud Management in Enterprise Manager - Index Note [ID 781879.1]
  </a>
  . This document says that the VM pack can be installed for OEM 10.2.0.5, OEM 11G, and OEM 12c. So, an upgrade to OEM 12c can be avoided, but I still need to upgrade GRIDCTRL to OEM 10.2.0.5.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is a feasible option with two (2) possibilities:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Upgrade GRIDCTRL to OEM 12c. A 32 bit version of OEM 12c exists.
  </li>
  <li>
   Upgrade GRIDCTRL to OEM 10.2.0.5. This is a smaller step.
  </li>
 </ol>
 <h3>
  <a name="TOC-Use-XEN-commands">
  </a>
  Use XEN commands
 </h3>
 <p>
  I could go through the pain of learning to use XEN commands from the
  <a href="http://xen.org" rel="nofollow">
   XEN
  </a>
  site.
 </p>
 <h3>
  <a name="TOC-Use-Cloud-Computing">
  </a>
  Use Cloud Computing
 </h3>
 <p>
  Cloud computing could be the way to go instead as I would get the use of a temporary machine that I could dispose of once I finish.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem would be of routing network traffic from the cloud into my home network. The ISP only gives me one (1) IP address behind which I hide all of my PCs behind NAT.
