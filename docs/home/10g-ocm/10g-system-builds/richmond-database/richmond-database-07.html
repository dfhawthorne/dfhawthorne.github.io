 <p>
  Finished rebuilding
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  from the
  <b>
   RHEL 3.7 1Gb
  </b>
  base image. Have installed the clusterware and asmlib driver.
 </p>
 <p>
  Before I install ASM and Oracle database software, I want to configure the Grid Control with agents on those images.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have been trying to make sense of the Enterprise Manager Grid Control installation documentation. There are several concepts of which I am stil unclear.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have downloaded the
  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/oem/htdocs/linuxsoft.html" rel="nofollow">
   10.2.0.1 software
  </a>
  (which is confusingly called "10.2.0.2"). This is the version to be used in the OCM exam.
 </p>
 <p>
  Have installed RHEL 4.2 on a 2Gb image using the defaults. This is called
  <b>
   Grid Control
  </b>
  . Have installed VMtools for clock synchronisation.
