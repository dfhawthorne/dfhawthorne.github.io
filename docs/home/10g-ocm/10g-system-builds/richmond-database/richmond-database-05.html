  The problem described in
  <a href="home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-database/richmond-database-04.html">
   Richmond Database (04)
  </a>
  appears to have been caused by an issue with the Ethernet emulation in VMware. This was fixed by a complete restart of the YAOCM team.
 </p>
 <p>
  That restart worked satisfactorily except that Oracle Enterrpise Manager was not able to access operating system metrics on
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  . At least, the RAC came up.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I did another restart, the ora.richmond1.ons resource failed to come online for
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  . This precluded the initialisation of the CRS stack there. The crs stack was working on
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  but the oracle instance failed to come up.
 </p>
 <p>
  I hope this is not another VMware issue.
