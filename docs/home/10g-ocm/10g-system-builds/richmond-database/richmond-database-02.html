 <p>
  Started installing the database on
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  . Found one (1) problem during the pre-installation checks: the
  <code>
   shmmax
  </code>
  parameter was too small on
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  but was correct on
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  . This was easily fixed by editting
  <code>
   /etc/sysctl.conf
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   sysctl -p
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the DBCA found a problem with ASM on
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  :
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Could not mount the diskgroup on remote node richmond2 using connection service richmond2:1521:+ASM2. Ensure that the listener is running on this node and the ASM instance is registered to the listener. Received the following error:
  </p>
  <p>
   ORA-15032: not all alterations performed
   <br/>
   ORA-15063: ASM discovered an insufficient number of disks for diskgroup "DATA"
  </p>
 </blockquote>
</div>
