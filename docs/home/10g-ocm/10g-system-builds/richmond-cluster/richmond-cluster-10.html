   Raw Devices on Linux
  </a>
  (Note:224302.1). Here the ownership should be oracle:dba. Still no help.
 </p>
 <p>
  Changed all the raw devices for ocr and voting disks to have ownership oracle:oinstall and permissions 660. To get past the voting disk screen, I created a cluster called richmond with only one (1) member (
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  ). The software was then installed on
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  successfully. The first root script (
  <code>
   $ORACLE_BASE/oraInventory/orainstRoot.sh
  </code>
  ) run successfully, but the second one (
  <code>
   $ORACLE_HOME/root.sh
  </code>
  ) failed:
  <br/>
  <code>
   # /u00/crs/oracle/product/10/app/root.sh
   <br/>
   Checking to see if Oracle CRS stack is already configured
   <br/>
   /etc/oracle does not exist. Creating it now.
   <br/>

   Setting the permissions on OCR backup directory

   Successfully accumulated necessary OCR keys.

   Failed to initialize Oracle Cluster Registry for cluster

 <p>
  I examined the script to see where these messages came out from, but could not see where they did. Tried running with
  <code>
   sh -x
  </code>
  . Only managed to get the image running at 100%. Powered off and on the image. Still got 100%. Deleted the image, and cloned
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  from
  <b>
   RHEL 3.7 1GB
  </b>
  again.
 </p>
 <p>
  This experiment has been very interesting in that the problems with
  <code>
   /dev/raw/raw2
  </code>
  occur when
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  is in the cluster definition. I will need to find out a better way of detecting the underlying error.
