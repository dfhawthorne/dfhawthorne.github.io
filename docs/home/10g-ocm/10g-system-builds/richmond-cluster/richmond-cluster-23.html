  The problem described in
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-22.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (22)
  </a>
  was caused by my adding a new PCI card to the
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  image and not using
  <code>
   kudzu
  </code>
  to configure the card.
 </p>
 <p>
  The strange thing is that crs worked fine without having access to the ocr or voting disks.
 </p>
 <p>
  So the output from the
  <code>
   ocrcheck
  </code>
  command was correct but misleading. The underlying problem was that the raw files were on an unconfigured PCI card.
