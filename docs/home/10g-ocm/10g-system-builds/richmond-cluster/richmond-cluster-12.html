 <p>
  Continuing the rebuild of
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Shutdown the image and added it to the
  <b>
   YAOCM
  </b>
  team. Started the team.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was no need to update the
  <code>
   ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  </code>
  file on
  <b>
   central
  </b>
  because the host ssh key is generated during the installation and is replicated during the cloning process.
 </p>
 <p>
  Regenerated the ssh keys for the oracle user as per
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-05.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (05)
  </a>
  and updated
  <code>
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
  </code>
  on all hosts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Created the oracle directories as per
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-06.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (06)
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Installed the hangcheck-timer as per
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-06.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (6)
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Loaded the clusterware installation software from the shared folder into
  <code>
   /home/oracle/installation
  </code>
  .
  <br/>
  <code>
   $ su - oracle
   <br/>
   $ mkdir ~/installation
   <br/>
   $ unzip /mnt/hgfs/OCM/10201_clusterware_linux32.zip -d ~/installation
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  Installed the
  <code>
   cvuqdisk
  </code>
  package as per
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-05.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (05)
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Ran the
  <code>
   cluvfy
  </code>
  pre-installation test for crs. Only got the same two (2) problems as noted before in
  <a href="home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/miscellaneous/cluvfy-crsinst.html">
   CLUVFY CRSINST
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Shutdown
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  and took a snapshot called precrsinst.
 </p>
 <p>
  Created
  <code>
   ~/.ssh/config
  </code>
  - see
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-06.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (06)
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Did the clusterware installation again - see
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-07.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (07)
  </a>
  for details.
  <br/>
  <code>
   $ ./runInstaller -debug -logLevel finest &gt;/tmp/install.log 2&gt;&amp;1
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  Did the run for the complete cluster, and
  <br/>
  <span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:48px;color:#ff0000">
   It Works!
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  Well, almost. Got the following error after running the root.sh on
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  :
  <br/>
  <code>
   Expecting the CRS daemons to be up within 600 seconds.
   <br/>
   Failure at final check of Oracle CRS stack.
   <br/>
   10
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  So the problem with the oracle permissions for the shared voting disks was really a problem about the partition table on the disk drive. Probably makes sense in some weird way.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continued with OUI and got the following error with the ONS configuration assistant:
  <br/>
  <code>
   Output generated from configuration assistant "Oracle Notification Server Configuration Assistant":
   <br/>
   Command = /u00/crs/oracle/product/10/app/bin/racgons add_config richmond1:6200 richmond2:6200
   <br/>
   <br/>
   Configuration assistant "Oracle Notification Server Configuration Assistant" failed
   <br/>
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   <br/>
   The "/u00/crs/oracle/product/10/app/cfgtoollogs/configToolFailedCommands" script contains all commands that failed, were skipped or were cancelled. This file may be used to run these configuration assistants outside of OUI. Note that you may have to update this script with passwords (if any) before executing the same.
   <br/>
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  Will look at this later.
