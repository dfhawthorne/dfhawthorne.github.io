  Started
  <b>

  </b>
  from the precrsinst snapshot. The error message was the same one as reported in
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/richmond-cluster/richmond-cluster-16.html" rel="nofollow">
   Richmond Cluster (16)
  </a>
  :
  <br/>
  The given interface(s), "eth0" is not public. Public interfaces should be used to configure virtual IPs.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, I ran
  <b>
   vipca
  </b>
  to configure the resources. Again, the
  <b>
   ora.richmond1.vip
  </b>
  resource failed to come online.
 </p>
 <p>
  At least OUI reported a successful installation.
