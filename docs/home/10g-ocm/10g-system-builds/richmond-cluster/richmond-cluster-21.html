  The ssh problem appears to be have been caused by having a dsa public key in the
  <code>
   id_rsa.pub
  </code>
  file.
 </p>
 <p>
  As usual, the ssh command was very helpful in diagnosing this problem by saying:
  <br/>
  <code>
   connection closed by 192.168.100.66
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was immediately evident from this message which is why it has taken me a day to work this out.
 </p>
 <p>
  Have to recover the keys on
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  and restore the authorized_keys on
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  .
 </p>
