 <p>
  Have given up on
  <b>
   penrith
  </b>
  and moved to
  <b>
   richmond
  </b>
  instead. Cloned
  <b>
   RHEL 3.7 1GB
  </b>
  image as
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  . Added three (3) shared 2Gb disk drives from
  <code>
   Virtual Machines\YAOCM\Richmond Shared\
  </code>
  : disk1.vmdk, disk2.vmdk, and disk3.vmdk. These were put on SCSI1:0, SCSI1:1, and SCSI1:2 respectively as independent and persistent.
 </p>
 <p>
  Updated the YAOCM team to remove
  <b>
   penrith
  </b>
  and add
  <b>
   richmond
  </b>
  . Leaving
  <b>
   penrith
  </b>
  as a reference site. Used the team editting feature to add two (2) NICs to each new image and assign them to the different LAN segments.
 </p>
 <p>
  Updated the following files with the code snippet from
  <a href="home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/miscellaneous/going-in-circles.html">
   Going in Circles
  </a>
  :
  <br/>
  <code>
   Virtual Machines\Richmond1\Richmond1.vmx
   <br/>
   Virtual Machines\Richmond2\Richmond2.vmx
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  Now rereading my blog to gather all the configuration information to set up this cluster from scratch.
