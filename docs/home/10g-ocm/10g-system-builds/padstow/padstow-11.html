  DB Recovery Cleanup
 </h3>
 <p>
  <p>
   During yesterday's recovery of the EXAMPLE database on the
   <strong>
    padstow
   </strong>
   cluster, I did not detect that the SPFILE on the +DATA disk group had the incorrect values for the CONTROLFILE parameter. This caused the automatic startup to fail.
  </p>
  <p>
   I found a
   <code>
    spfileexample2.ora
   </code>
   in the
   <code>
    $ORACLE_HOME/dbs
   </code>
   directory on
   <strong>
    padstow2
   </strong>
   . Since I was using that node to do the database recovery, the correct SPFILE was being used during the various startups. The appearance on the local disk was a result of not specifying a destination for the SPFILE in the
   <code>
    CREATE SPFILE FROM PFILE
   </code>
   command.
  </p>
  <p>
   I used ASMCMD to find the latest versions of the control files in the +DATA and +FRA disk groups, and created aliases (via mkalias) from the EXAMPLE directories of these disk groups.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Created a text version of the spfile:
   </li>
   <pre>STARTUP NOMOUNT
CREATE PFILE='/home/oracle/initexample1.ora' FROM SPFILE;
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
EXIT
</pre>
   <li>
    edited
    <code>
     /home/oracle/initexample1.ora
    </code>
    to update the CONTROLFILE parameters to use the aliases I created.
   </li>
   <li>
    Use the updated PFILE to create a new SPFILE:
   </li>
   <pre>STARTUP NOMOUNT PFILE='/home/oracle/initexample1.ora'
CREATE SPFILE='+DATA' FROM PFILE='/home/oracle/initexample1.ora';
SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE
STARTUP
</pre>
  </ol>
  <p>
   The use of aliases should avoid the necessity of updating the SPFILE in future whenever the name of the control file changes.
  </p>
  <p>
   It would appear that the old archived redo log files on the +FRA disk group got corrupted blocks. I needed to delete all of these old archived redo log files in order to get a clean backup.
