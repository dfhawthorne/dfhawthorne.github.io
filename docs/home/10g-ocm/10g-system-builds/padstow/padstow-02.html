  Had problems with the interconnect on
  <strong>
   padstow1
  </strong>
  . The eth1 interface failed to come up. Found the following message in /var/log/messages :
 </p>
 <pre>ifup: Error, some other host already uses address 192.168.101.1
</pre>
 <p>
  The reason for this turns out to be that the Vaio had been allocated 192.168.101.1 via DHCP from VMware network.
 </p>
 <p>
  Editted
  <code>
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
  </code>
  to change the IP address. Had to use service network restart to fix eth1. Also updated
  <code>
   /etc/hosts
  </code>
  to set the private interconnect address to 192.168.101.3 on both nodes.
 </p>
 <p>
  There was a subtle problem with the shared OCR disks.
  <strong>
   padstow1
  </strong>
  would report that integrity check would fail (ocrcheck) but ocrdump could extract the OCR data.
  <strong>
   padstow2
  </strong>
  would report no problems. The solution is to start
  <strong>
   padstow1
  </strong>
  first then
  <strong>
   padstow2
  </strong>
  . Yet another feature of VMware.
 </p>
 <p>
  Because this problem was not detected during installation until the configuration assistant stage, I had to manually run the failed commands myself.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I forgot to run
  <code>
   vipca
  </code>
  after the clusterware installation, I now have a single node ASM setup.
