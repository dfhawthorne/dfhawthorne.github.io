  Solved the ASM single instance problem by removing the init.ora, spfile, pwdfile and the admin subdirectories. Also removed the associated listener files as well as the CRS resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  The root cause was the lack of CRS resource definitions for the ASM instances. DBCA seems to think that no definitions in the OCR means that the ASM instance is a singleton even the +ASM database is defined as clustered in the SPFILE.
 </p>
 <p>
  Once I was certain that the OCR was correct and available on both nodes, I used NETCA to create
  <strong>
   LISTENER_ASM
  </strong>
  and then used DBCA to configure +ASM.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, I ran into the problem of the DATA disk group unable to be mounted on
  <strong>
   padstow2
  </strong>
  . A cluster restart fixed the problem. Linux is turning into a Windows clone slowly.
 </p>
 <p>
  Installed the Oracle database software into the DB_1 home. Created another listener called
  <strong>
   LISTENER_EXAMPLE
  </strong>
  in this home. Used DBCA to create the EXAMPLE database using the sample schemae using ASM.
