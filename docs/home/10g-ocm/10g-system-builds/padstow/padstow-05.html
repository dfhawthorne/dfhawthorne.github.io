  Was able to create the EXAMPLE database on
  <strong>
   padstow
  </strong>
  cluster without any problems. Must have done something wrong!
 </p>
 <p>
  When I tried to backup the EXAMPLE database, I found that the RMAN catalogue was not active. Had hit
  <cite>
   ORA-600 [1114] "Memory freelist corruption"
  </cite>
  in +ASM on
  <strong>
   rmancat
  </strong>
  . ASM died bringing down the RMAN catalogue.
