  It has taken me three (3) attempts to get a good backup of the
  <strong>
   padstow
  </strong>
  cluster.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attempt #1 failed because of corrupt blocks in the SYSAUX tablespace again! Since I did not have a valid backup, I could not recover from the block corruptions. Deleted and created the EXAMPLE database once more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Attempt #2 failed because the ASM instance on
  <strong>
   padstow2
  </strong>
  would not start. This backup could be okay because the archived redo log files are in the shared storage.
 </p>
 <p>
  After a cluster reboot, both nodes of the cluster database came online and I was able to get a full backup.
 </p>
 <p>
  Some interesting commands:
 </p>
 <pre>BACKUP VALIDATE DATABASE;
</pre>
 <p>
  This RMAN command reads all of the disk blocks to find corrupted ones without stopping at the first corrupted one. These blocks are listed in the
  <code>
   V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION
  </code>
  view.
 </p>
 <pre>BLOCKRECOVER CORRUPTION LIST;
</pre>
 <p>
  This RMAN command reads the list of blocks from
  <code>
   V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION
  </code>
  and attempts to fix them. How simple is this?
