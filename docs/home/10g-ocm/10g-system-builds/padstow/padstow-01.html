  I have restarted the installation I began in
  <a href="http://yaocm.bigblog.com.au/post.do?id=206768" rel="nofollow">

  I found a nasty little problem with
  <strong>
   Manage Virtual Networks
  </strong>
  under Vista. This program has to be started by right clicking on the program name and selecting
  <em>
   Run As Administrator.
  </em>
  If this is not done, no changes to the VMware networks can be made.

  Basic networking and disk layout has been configured for the cluster. I can do this from memory now. Maybe I am getting a little too cocky.
