  The
  <strong>
   padstow
  </strong>
  cluster had a few problems over the past week:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The DATA disk group got corrupted again (the same tablespace was affected - SYSAUX).
  </li>
  <li>
   The cluster had timing problems - at one point the
   <strong>
    padstow2
   </strong>
   node was nine (9) seconds ahead of
   <strong>
    padstow1
   </strong>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The Grid Control agent was not collecting data or picking up targets on either node of the cluster.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Now I know there are some errors that ASM cannot protect against. I had to do a PITR because the archive logs were not duplexed across the DATA and FRA disk groups. At least, I am getting practice with RMAN backups and restorations.
 </p>
 <p>
  To overcome the timing problems, I decided to go back to using NTP with
  <strong>
   gridctrl
  </strong>
  as the local NTP server. Although the other nodes recognise
  <strong>
   gridctrl
  </strong>
  as a peer (via ntpq peer), they still insist on using the local clock as the timing source.
 </p>
 <p>
  The implementation procedure for NTP I have been using is:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   <code>
    vi /etc/ntp.conf
   </code>
   (to add "server gridctrl")
  </li>
  <li>
   Get the
   <code>
    ntp
   </code>
   service to recognise the new NTP server:
  </li>
  <pre>service ntpd restart
ntptime # to check the time
</pre>
 </ol>
 <p>
  The Grid Control agent took several attempts at reinstallation before all the targets were detected. I am still having data collection errors. At least, I did not have to recreate the cluster from scratch to get this far.
