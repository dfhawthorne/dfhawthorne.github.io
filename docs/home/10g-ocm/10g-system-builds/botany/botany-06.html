  The
  <strong>
   botany
  </strong>
  cluster had a problem with the eth0 not being connected to the home LAN. The problem was being caused by VMware selecting the Gigabit Ethernet interface instead of the Fast Ethernet card.
 </p>
 <p>
  The problem was solved by configuring "Manage Virtual Networks" to still automatically select a NIC to bridge to while not considering the Gigabit Ethernet card. Sometime like freedom of choice under Communism - you can choose any candidate from a list of one (1)!
