  I have cloned
  <strong>
   botany1
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>
   botany2
  </strong>
  off the
  <em>
   RHEL 3.7 1Gb
  </em>
  image and set up Ethernet Card #2 to use VMnet3 network (192.168.102.0).
 </p>
 <p>
  Clusterware has been successfully even though the configuration assistants step failed as usual (ran vipca after reboot to fix) even though
  <strong>
   botany2
  </strong>
  reported integrity errors with the OCR.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am going forward with the base installation of software instead of cloning Oracle homes across the network because I understand the former while the latter has a lot of provisios such as no configuration which really renders the option moot if OUI is used.
