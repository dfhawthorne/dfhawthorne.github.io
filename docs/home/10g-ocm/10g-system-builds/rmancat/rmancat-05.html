  Following my panegyic about patching under Grid Control in
  <a href="home/10g-ocm/10g-system-builds/rmancat/rmancat-04.html">
   RMANCAT (04)
  </a>
  , I decided to read the description in
  <a href="http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B16240_01/doc/em.102/e10954/deploy_proc.htm#sthref830" rel="nofollow">
   Using Enterprise Manager For Grid Automation With Deployment Procedures
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Big mistake. My brain froze. I cannot understand the documentation. After struggling with this for a while, I gave up and went back to the old-fashioned way of using OUI.
 </p>
 <p>
  RMANCAT has now been patched to 10.2.0.2 successfully for the third time. The RMAN catalogue was upgraded as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will stick to OUI for the OCM exam, if I have a choice.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Grid Control way has potential.
