  Still playing with Grid Control.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have managed to edit the hosts file on the Vaio (Vista) by using the procedure from
  <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/thibbard/archive/2006/12/13/ChangingYourHostsFileInVista.aspx" rel="nofollow">
   Changing your hosts file in Vista
  </a>
  . I can access the
  <b>
   gridctrl
  </b>
  from the Vaio after I enable the Intranet settings (which is apparently less secure than the Internet!).
 </p>
 <p>
  The advantage of using IE7 on Vista over XP Pro is that the pop-ups do not lock out. This is very important when uploading patches.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have manage to upload P4547817 (10.2.0.2 for Linux x86) via the Patch Cache link on the Deployments tab of Grid Control.
 </p>
 <p>
  The patching is tricky because with ASM, I had to select Oracle Homes then select ASM. The ASM instance does not appear under Oracle Instances.
 </p>
 <p>
  I submitted the job but the job was suspended because I did not allow jobs to run when I started the blackout on
  <b>
   rmancat
  </b>
  . I had to end the blackout and start it again.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even when I allow jobs to run during blackouts, the patch job is still suspended due to blackout. This could be caused by clock skew on
  <b>
   rmancat
  </b>
  . I thought I had corrected this through VMtools.
 </p>
 <p>
  Overall, I am impressed by the patch management facilities of Grid Control. Without my MetaLink account, I cannot test the automatic download feature. But the manual archiving of patches works. I have successfully patch ASM and an Oracle database.
 </p>
 <p>
  There is one serious gotcha: this method of patching copies the patch files into each Oracle home that is patched. I got caught out by running out of disk space.
