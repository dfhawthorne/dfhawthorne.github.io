  There is nothing like a progress report to get me going.
 </p>
 <p>
  I managed to download CD's #1 to #4 of Enterprise Unix from Oracle last night. The first two (2) took two (2) hours each before 22:00 but the other two (2) took about 40 minutes each at 04:00 to 06:00 this morning. This was over ADSL+ on the Liberty plan.

 <p>
  The total download was about 2.5 Gb.Â  The ZIP files have minimal compression.
