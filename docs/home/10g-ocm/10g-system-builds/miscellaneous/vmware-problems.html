 <p>
  I am having problems with starting the VMware team (YAOCM). The message is:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   Could not open virtual machine: ...
  </p>
  <p>
   Something is wrong with the configuration file
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  The application event log shows: Cannot connect to VMX. There does not appear to be any useful stuff from Google except bitching about Vista.
 </p>
 <p>
  This problem does not affect all of my VM images. The base OS ones are still okay.
 </p>
 <p>
  Since I now have extra time, I can restart the rebuild. The plan is:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Build RMANCAT again on RHEL 4.2 using Oracle 10.2.0.2
  </li>
  <li>
   Create a RAC at Padstow (Richmond no longer rocks)
  </li>
  <li>
   Create a RAC at Botany
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Instead of using a team, I will using the VMnet for the interconnects.
 </p>
