  Because I was using VMWare Workstation 5.5.3, I varied the installation process from that of
  <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/chan-ubl-vmware.html#2" rel="nofollow">
   Vincent Chan
  </a>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Set Access Rights - Not Applicable
  </li>
  <li>
   Startup / Shutdown Options - Not Applicable
  </li>
  <li>
   Virtual machine account - Not Applicable
  </li>
  <li>
   Memory for the Virtual Machine - Set to 192Mb
  </li>
  <li>
   Network connection: Host Only.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The reasons for the variance in procedure are that I have less than the recommended amount of RAM and I am paranoid about opening the VM image to the Internet.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I tried setting up the ocfs2disk.vmdk drive on device node SCSI 1:0, I get the following message:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  The node SCSI(0:7) is currently occupied by another device. Please select a different node.
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  When I changed the device node to SCSI 2:0, this was accepted and the file was created.
 </p>
 <p>
  I used device node SCSI 2:1 for asmdisk1.vmdk just because I was not too sure about reusing SCSI 2:0. I used SCSI 2:2 and SCSI 2:3 for the other two (2) ASM disks.
 </p>
 <p>
  I changed the original Ethernet adapter to Custom using VMNet 1, and added the second Ethernet adapter also as Custom but using VMNet 2.
 </p>
 <p>
  Editing "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.vmx", I added the following lines:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <code>
   disk.locking = "FALSE"
   <br/>
   diskLib.dataCacheMaxSize = "0"
   <br/>
   scsi2.sharedBus = "virtual"
   <br/>
   scsi2:0.deviceType = "disk"
   <br/>
   scsi2:1.deviceType = "disk"
   <br/>
   scsi2:2.deviceType = "disk"
   <br/>
   scsi2:3.deviceType = "disk"
  </code>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  After examining the VMX file, I feel more comfortable about changing the device nodes because the nodes allocated in Vincent Chan's article match what I manually configured.
 </p>
 <p>
  I will leave the Linux installation until later.
