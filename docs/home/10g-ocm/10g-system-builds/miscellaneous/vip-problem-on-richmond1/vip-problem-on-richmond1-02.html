 <p>
  The problem with VIPCA is that it does not recreate the resources.
 </p>
 <p>
  I tried:
  <span style="font-family:Courier New">
   crs_unregister ora.richmond1.vip
  </span>
 </p>
 <p>
  But I got an error message about a missing resource when using
  <code>
   vipca
  </code>
  . Decided to revert to snapshot
  <code>
   crsinst
  </code>
  but I have managed to stuff things up that badly.
