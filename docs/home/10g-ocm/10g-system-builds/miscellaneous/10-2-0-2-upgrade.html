  I have now successfully upgraded a singleton 10.2.0.1 database with and without ASM. My only worry is that the upgrade script (catupgrd.sql) takes over one (1) hour to run on my VAIO. Fortunately, this script does not have to be run for the ASM instance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Still, I could be looking atabout 4.5hours to get a 10.2.0.2 instance running with ASM. I cannot afford to make any mistakes with this.
  <br/>
  (1) 30 Minutes planning
  <br/>
  (2) 30 minutes for Linux configuration changes (depending on what packages have been installed)
  <br/>
  (3) 30 minutes for 10.2.0.1 installation of ASM database software
  <br/>
  (4) 30 minutes for 10.2.0.1 installation of user database software
  <br/>
  (5) 30 minutes for creation and backup of user database
  <br/>
  (6) 30 minutes for 10.2.0.2 upgrade of ASM database
  <br/>
  (7) 90 minutes for 10.2.0.2 upgrade of user database
 </p>
 <p>
  It looks like I will have to juggle many installations at the same time in order to meet the timings for all the installation scenarios. If there are four (4) scenarios per day, then I am looking at an average of 2.5 hours per scenario.
 </p>
 <p>
  The minimum number of Linux boxes that need to be installed are:
  <br/>
  2 for the primary RAC (10.2.0.1)
  <br/>
  2 for the physical standby RAC (10.2.0.1)
  <br/>
  1 for Grid Control (10.1.0.3)
  <br/>
  2 for ODD and EVEN (10.2.0.2)
 </p>
