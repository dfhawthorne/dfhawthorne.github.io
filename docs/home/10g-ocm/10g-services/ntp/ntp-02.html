  NTP on penrith1/2

 <p>
  I tried setting up NTP on penrith1 using the following procedure:
 </p>
 <p>
  rpmquery ntp (to see if the package was installed - yes - ntp-4.1.2-4.EL3.1)
 </p>
 <p>
  service ntpd status (to see if the daemon was running - ntpd is stopped)
 </p>
 <p>
  chkconfig --list ntpd (to see if the service was defined - yes, but not enabled at any run level)
 </p>
 <p>
  chkconfig --level 345 ntpd on (to run ntpd when in one of the multiuser modes)
 </p>
 <p>
  vi /etc/ntp.conf (to add the following lines):
 </p>
 <p>
  restrict central.yaocm.id.au mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap
  <br/>
  server central.yaocm.id.au
 </p>
 <p>
  service ntpd restart (to read the updated configuration file)
 </p>
 <p>
  date (to check if the image clock was the same as the PC clock - no)
 </p>
 <p>
  tail -20 /var/log/messages (to see what the error messages were)
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   getnetum central.yaocm.id.au: invalid host number, line ignored
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  ping -c 4 central.yaocm.id.au (to check connectivity - failed - unknown host)
 </p>
 <p>
  vi /etc/hosts (to add entry for 192.168.100.97 central.yaocm.id.au)
 </p>
 <p>
  ping now works
 </p>
 <p>
  date is still wrong
 </p>
 <p>
  service ntpd restart (to rebuild ntp service)
 </p>
 <p>
  date still wrong
 </p>
 <p>
  Same error message in /var/log/messages
 </p>
 <p>
  Google pointed me to
  <a href="http://lists.ntp.isc.org/pipermail/questions/2003-October/000999.html" rel="nofollow">
   Translation names to IP is not working
  </a>
  . Problem was with the use of the host name instead of an IP address in the restrict statement.
 </p>
 <p>
  vi /etc/ntp.conf (to change central.yaocm.id.au to 192.168.100.97 in restrict command)
 </p>
 <p>
  service ntpd restart
 </p>
 <p>
  date still wrong
 </p>
 <p>
  No error messages for this incarnation of ntpd in /var/log/messages
 </p>
 <p>
  Took a half-hour break.
 </p>
 <p>
  Looked at /var/log/messages, found:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   time correction of -7920 seconds exceeds sanity limit (1000); set clock manually to the correct UTC time.
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  date -u 042112402008 (the convoluted time format of month, day, hour, minute, and year is probably makes sense to some geek somewhere in the USA)
  <br/>
  Mon Apr 21 12:40:00 UTC 2008
 </p>
 <p>
  That sanity check message was the last thing sent before the daemon died. This I found out when I tried to restart ntpd.
 </p>
 <p>
  Watched log via tail -f /var/log/messages for about twenty minutes with a problem on penrith1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Made similar changes on penrith2. Except that I get messages of the following type in /var/log/messages:
 </p>
 <blockquote>
  <p>
   kernel: set_rtc_mmss: can't update from nn to nn
  </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>
  <a href="http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=132531.html" rel="nofollow">
   ntpd and kernel message set_rtc_mmss: can't update
  </a>
  could be relevant
 </p>
 <p>
  Checked the time on all three (3) servers and found the following discrepencies:
 </p>
 <table border="1">
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>
     central
    </td>
    <td>
     23:13:56
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>
     penrith1
    </td>
    <td>
     23:06:41
    </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>
     penrith2
    </td>
    <td>
     23:09:42
    </td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>
 <p>
  From this, I would say that ntp is not set up correctly because the times should all be the same.
