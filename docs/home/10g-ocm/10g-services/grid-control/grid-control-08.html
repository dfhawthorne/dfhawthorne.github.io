  I have managed to get around the startup problems with
  <b>
   gridctrl
  </b>
  temporarily by starting the systems individually and waiting for initialisation to complete.
 </p>
 <p>
  As such, I am able to run all four (4) systems satisfactorily at this stage.
 </p>
 <p>
  To the OMS agent to start on
  <b>
   richmond1
  </b>
  and
  <b>
   richmond2
  </b>
  , I had to set the default runlevel to 3 via /etc/inittab . This would be a consistent design approach by Oracle to have all managed servers running without X11 in multiuser mode.
 </p>
 <p>
  Although the agents are running on both nodes of the
  <b>
   richmond
  </b>
  cluster, the OMS web page does not display the hosts.

  It would appear that the collected data has not been uploaded to the repository. Since there has been no attempts at upload, I would assume that the agent installation is incomplete.
