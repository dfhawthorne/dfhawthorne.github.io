  I have a serious performance problem with
  <b>
   gridctrl
  </b>
  . /var/log/messages reports that:
  <br/>
  <code>
   gcstartup: ias-component/process-type/process-set:
   <br/>
   gcstartup: OC4J/OC4J_EM/default_island
   <br/>
   gcstartup:
   <br/>
   gcstartup: Error
   <br/>
   gcstartup: --&gt; Process (pid=3139)
   <br/>
   gcstartup: time out while waiting for a managed process to start
   <br/>
   su(pam_unix)[3074]: session closed for user oracle

   gcstartup: Log:

   gcstartup: /u00/app/oracle/OracleHomes/oms10g/opmn/logs/OC4J~OC4J_EM~default_island~1
  </code>
 </p>
 <p>
  This is causing the intermittent problems with OMS.
 </p>
 <p>
  I have installed the Grid Control agent on both nodes of the
  <b>
   richmond
  </b>
  cluster by using OUI from the OEM installation files.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get around the Grid Control problem, I am considering buying a cheap desktop (AUD500) with 1Gb RAM and installing RHEL 4.2 AS there. My current Linux desktop has 256Mb RAM and instructions in Chinese. This could be a good time to upgrade.
 </p>
 <p>
  This will cause some configuration issues in that I will have to implement NTP and set up a special LAN for this.
