  I managed to find an old 10/100 Ethernet card from four (4) years ago. The top PCI slot was not picked up by kudzu but the lower one was.

  The installation of Grid Control on the Lenovo was successful once I worked out that the prerequisite check was stuffed (see

  Even with a dual-CPU box with 2Gb RAM, the Grid Control was consuming 50% CPU. No wonder VMware was struggling.
