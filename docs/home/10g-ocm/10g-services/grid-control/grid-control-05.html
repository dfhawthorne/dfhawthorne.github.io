  The problem described in
  <a href="/home/10g-ocm/10g-services/grid-control/grid-control-04.html" rel="nofollow">
   Grid Control (04)
  </a>
  was caused by the OMS not running on
  <b>
   gridctrl
  </b>
  after a restart.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I started the Oracle instance (emrep), Oracle listener (LISTENER), and the OMS service, I was able to acces the OMS page.
 </p>
 <p>
  The root.sh script in OMS_HOME updates the /etc/gcstartup which only gets called when the runlevel is set to 3. (I found the solution at
  <a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=355295" rel="nofollow">
   Thread: auto startup script in 10g rel2
  </a>
  )
 </p>
 <p>
  Editted /etc/inittab to change the default runlevel and rebooted.
 </p>
 <p>
  Except there is now a problem with the Virtual LAN and my MetaLink account is expired!
