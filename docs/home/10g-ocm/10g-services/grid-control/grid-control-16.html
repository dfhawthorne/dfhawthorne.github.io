  One of the problems I encounter with Grid Control is that provisioning jobs fail with the following message:
 </p>
 <pre>Failed during Get or Create HardwareServer Entry: 2
</pre>
 <p>
  MetaLink DocID 376937.1 appears to be relevant. I had gone through and manually refreshed all of the configurations for the hosts with the failing jobs.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another problem is with Warning Alerts with the following message:
 </p>
 <pre>Missing value for ARG in RemoteOperationArgument
</pre>
 <p>
  MetaLink DocID 399350.1 appears to be relevant. Unfortunately, the remedy is to upgrade OMS to 10.2.0.4 which is outside the specifications of the OCM examination.
