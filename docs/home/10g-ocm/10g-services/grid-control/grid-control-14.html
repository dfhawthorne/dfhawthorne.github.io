  One (1) target warning message on
  <b>
   gridctrl
  </b>
  related to performance.
 </p>
 <p>
  Guess what? AWR is not installed in the
  <b>
   emrep
  </b>
  database. Used
  <code>
   @?/rdbms/admin/catawr
  </code>
  to install AWR, and I installed StatsPack at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The other seven (7) all relate to the issue identified in
  <a href="home/10g-ocm/10g-services/grid-control/grid-control-13.html" rel="nofollow">
   Grid Control (11)
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This does not make sense. Something is wrong here.
 </p>
 <p>
  I checked the logs outside of Grid Control by browsing
  <code>
   $ORACLE_HOME/OracleHomes/oms10g/Apache/Apache/logs/error_log.1212710400
  </code>
  , and found many errors like the following:
 </p>
 <pre>[Fri Jun 6 21:54:28 2008] [error] [client 192.168.0.202]
  [ecid: 1212753268:192.168.0.200:3367:0:872,0] client denied by server configuration:
  /em/upload/
</pre>
 <p>
  It would appear that
  <b>
   rmancat
  </b>
  (192.168.0.202) is trying to upload data to
  <b>
   gridctrl
  </b>
  but is being refused permission to do so.
