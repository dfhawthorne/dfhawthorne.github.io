  I am still having problems with setting up Data Guard. I think my problem has been that I am attempting the more complex configuration (RAC) first.
 </p>
 <p>
  To overcome this, I am trying to set up a physical Data Guard configuration using the RMAN catalogue with the primary on RMANCAT and the standby on RMANDOG. This should be easier as this is a single instance to single instance configuration.
