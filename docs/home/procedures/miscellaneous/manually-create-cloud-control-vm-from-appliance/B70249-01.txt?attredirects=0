Oracle VM Template for Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c Release 2 (12.1.0.2) Media Pack v1 for x86 (64 bit)



This document contains information on the Oracle VM Template for Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c Release 2. This template can be used to provision new guest virtual machines running Enterprise Manager Cloud Control 12c Release 2 Oracle Management Service (OMS), Oracle Management Agent and Repository Database.

One of the following options can be used:

- Creating Guest Virtual Machine from Oracle VM Template using Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Console
- Creating Guest Virtual Machine from Oracle VM Template from Oracle VM server terminal

Creating Guest Virtual Machine from Oracle VM Template using Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Console
=======================================================

Downloading the files
---------------------
1. Download the template files on a Linux machine running an EM 12cR2 agent.For example, if the directory you choose on the machine is /scratch, the files will be located as follows:

/scratch/V34441-01.zip
/scratch/V34442-01.zip
/scratch/V34443-01.zip

2. The downloaded files are compressed with the zip format. Use any unzip tool to uncompress the file, or download a utility from eDelivery http://updates.oracle.com/unzips/unzips.html. This will generate the compressed tar file.

# cd /scratch

# unzip V34441-01.zip
# unzip V34442-01.zip
# unzip V34443-01.zip

This will create files with ".tgz" extension.

3. Run the following command to create the "OVM_EM12R2" directory and extract the files there:

# cat OVM_EM12R2*.tgz | tar -xzvf -
(note the "-" at the end of the command)

Creating a Software Library component
-------------------------------------
1. Go to the Enterprise Manager -> Provisioning and Patching -> Software Library page

2. Use the "Create Entity" operation to create a Software Library component.

3. When creating a "Template" component, you will be asked to choose an option to pick the source of the Template binaries. Select "Agent Upload" to upload the binaries from the directory (for example, /scratch) on the agent machine to the Software Library storage.

Creating the Guest VM
-------------------
Go to the Enterprise Manager Cloud Control Console

1. Navigate to Enterprise Manager -> Infrastructure Cloud homepage

2. Use the "Deploy Template" operation on a server pool to create Guest virtual machine

a. Pick the Software Library component for the template and deploy.

Refer to section "Administering and Monitoring the Cloud for IaaS" in the Enterprise Manager Cloud Administration Guide to learn how to deploy guest virtual machines using Oracle VM Templates:

http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24628_01/doc.121/e28814/cloud_virtual.htm#BJEJDFGE

3. Once the job to deploy the template completes, you should be able to go to the "Launch VNC console" operation to get VNC access to the machine.

Follow the instructions in the "Configuring the Guest Virtual Machine using VNC console" section below to configure the Guest virtual machine.

Creating Guest Virtual Machine from Oracle VM Template from Oracle VM server terminal
==========================================================

Downloading the files
---------------------
1. Download the template files in /OVS/running_pool directory on Oracle VM server:

/OVS/running_pool/V34441-01.zip
/OVS/running_pool/V34442-01.zip
/OVS/running_pool/V34443-01.zip

2. The downloaded files are compressed with the zip format. Use any unzip tool to uncompress the file, or download a utility from eDelivery http://updates.oracle.com/unzips/unzips.html. This will generate the compressed tar file.

# cd /OVS/running_pool

# unzip V34441-01.zip
# unzip V34442-01.zip
# unzip V34443-01.zip

This will create files with ".tgz" extension.

3. Run the following command to create the "OVM_EM12R2" directory and extract the files there:

# cat OVM_EM12R2*.tgz | tar -xzvf -
(note the "-" at the end of the command)

4. Edit the file /OVS/running_pool/OVM_EM12R2/vm.cfg and replace the occurrences of the string "seed_pool" with "running_pool".

5. Instructions to set up the mac address :

a) Run the following python command to generate a new MAC address
# PYTHONPATH=/opt/ovs-agent-2.2 python -c \
"from OVSCommons import randomMAC; print randomMAC()"

b) Edit the vm.cfg file and change the line starting with 'vif' to
vif = [ 'bridge=<bridge_name>, mac=00:16:3E:xx:xx:xx', ] # for PVM
or
vif = [ 'bridge=<bridge_name>, type=netfront, mac=00:16:3E:xx:xx:xx', ] # for PVHVM
where 00:16:3E:xx:xx:xx is the MAC address generated in the previous step,
and <bridge_name> is the name of the bridge to be used for this guest VM.

Creating the Guest VM:
----------------------
1. Login to the Oracle VM server machine

2. Create a Guest Virtual Machine
# cd /OVS/running_pool/OVM_EM12R2
# xm create vm.cfg

3. Use VNC Viewer to access the Guest Virtual Machine as it boots up

a. Use the following command on the Oracle VM server to know the VNC port of the guest virtual machine:

# virsh dumpxml <guest_virtual_machine_name>

Note: On Oracle VM server, the vncunused=1 parameter allocates a new VNC port number each time a guest virtual machine is created. Port numbers are allocated starting at the default VNC port number 5900 -- so first Guest is allocated port 5900, second Guest is allocated port 5901, third Guest gets port 5902, and so on.

b. Access the VNC console

<Oracle VM Hostname>:<VNC port of the guest virtual machine>

No password is required. Generally, if this is the first Guest VM on the Oracle VM server, you can VNC to <Oracle VM Hostname>:5900

Configuring Guest VM from the VNC console
=========================================

On accessing the VNC console of the guest virtual machine, you will be prompted to enter the information below.

Configure Networking
--------------------

Enter IP address: [dhcp_ip]
=>input the static IP or leave blank for DHCP assigned IP

Enter netmask address:[dhcp_netmask]
=>input the netmask

Enter hostname: [dhcp_hostname]
=>input the full hostname like: <hostname>.<domainname>

Enter default gateway IP address: [dhcp_gw]
=>input the default gateway IP address

Enter DNS server IP address: [dhcp_dns]

Configuring the Enteprise Manager OMS, Agent and Repository
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following questions are then asked:

a. Provide the password for the database account
=> Please specify a password for the database accounts SYS, SYSTEM, SYSMAN and DBSNMP

b. Provide your email address if you want Oracle to contact you with security updates

Do you want to provide your email address to be informed of security issues and initiate configuration manager? (y|N) [y]:

=> Select y and provide the email address

You can now login to the Guest VM after the deployment/config completes.

Note: After the creation of the guest virtual machine it is recommended to change all passwords (that of the database accounts and O/S accounts) to facilitate Separation of Duty.
