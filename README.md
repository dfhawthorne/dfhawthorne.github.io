### Release Schedule

I am allowing one (1) week per milestone. There are seven (7) milestones for each [exam objective](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-2024-networking-professional/pexam_1Z0-1124-24), and one (1) milestone to establish the environment for study. I should gain the certification sometime in November 2024. I am currently running four (4) months late because I discovered that I needed to complete the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2024 Architect Associate](https://education.oracle.com/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-2024-architect-associate/pexam_1Z0-1072-24) to better understand OCI concepts.
